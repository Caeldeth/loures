# The Drowning of Cesion

_by Raeven in **Dark Ages**_

Tell me once more of the crack in the earth,   
Of one aisling's pride, and Fiosachd's mirth.    
Tell me why Rucesion's broken in twain -    
Why some will never see sunshine again.   

Listen, my students, and learn from me well:   
The world was once broken by one careless spell  
During the era when magic was new  
And no one conceived what its power could do.  
Rucesion used to be two towns, not one -  
Joined here by a bridge whereas now there is none.  
Everything west 'cross this bridge was once called  
The island of Cesion, where all those enthralled  
With primal forces of nature revealed  
As four sep'rate powers, with mys'tries concealed,  
Could study in peace, and search without fear,  
For knowledge forbidden elsewhere far and near.  

Argent Muenno did seek to obtain  
The power of water, of oceans, of rain.  
Sal so intrigued him he sought to command �  
Its magick mystery by his own hand.  
He researched experiments, theories, and lore  
Which aislings had never uncovered before.  
Word of his prowess had spread through the town,  
Till every last aisling knew of his renown.  

With only an inkling of what he could do,  
Argent felt pressured to show what he knew.  
He stood at the juncture of water and land,  
And cast a spell he did not understand.  
He called upon nature, he prayed for good luck,  
For what he needed: for skill and for pluck.  
As dozens of witnesses stood all around,  
He cast meur sal on the sea and the ground.  
He drew back in horror but it was too late -  
His pride and his haste had sealed Cesion's fate.  

The earth lurched and buckled, the ocean did swell;  
Thunder boomed and pounding rain fell.  
The wizards who'd gathered to heckle and jeer  
Grew suddenly panicked, their eyes filled with fear.  
A mighty wave rose like a gigantic hand  
And swallowed the buildings, the crowd, the land.  
Argent stared as they sank to the sand,  
As his spell continued to build and expand.  
The wizards turned into merfolk with tails,  
Their pale skin like silver with pearly fish scales.  
The buildings of Cesion, the trees and the grass,  
Transformed into seaweed and coral and glass.  
Argent alone was preserved to relate  
The truth of his research, his errors, his fate.  

And so our fair city is half what it was;  
We lost friends and loved ones to magick because  
One man let fame and ambition oer'take  
His reason and caution - he made a mistake.  
Now next time you're standing next to the shore,  
Look into the water and realize there's more  
To Rucesion than what stays earthbound and dry,  
To what you can see 'neath the sun and the sky.
