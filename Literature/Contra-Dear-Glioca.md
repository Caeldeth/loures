# Dear Glioca

_by Contra in **Dark Ages**_

For every tear drop that I cry  
Another star appears in the sky  
For every time I say I love you  
It makes an aisling believe in life too  
For every smile that I give  
It's one more reason for me too live  
For every breath I seem to take  
It makes me stronger so I won't break  
For every step forward I go  
A step backwards is erased I know  
And for every time I hold my head high  
I know Glioca is watching proudly from the sky.
