# Iksander Deathstalker

_by Wintereagle of **Dark Ages**_

Through dark like night,  
stalked the stalker of death.  
Through the crypt Iksander strode,  
evil fleeing from his mighty gaze.

Down past terrors unimagined,  
through hells more hellish than imagination.  
The stalker of death never flinching,  
down, down, down, always down.

Then, upon a solitary room  
does the stalker of death happen upon.  
There, in that room, Iksander was alone,

but for one thing...  
Wings of black darker than night,  
taller than the pillars of the tomb itself,  
flowing hair the color of dead grapes,

The Succubi.  
The brave stalker of death stared,  
entranced by the gaze of the Succubi,  
she said only one word,  
and the stalker of death went up in flames.

Deathstalker, where art thee now,  
does thine heart still burn for the seductress  
or does it burn with her magic  
Deathstalker, death has been stalking thee,  
and death has won
