# The Glade of the Fae

_by TsubameSho in **Dark Ages**_

Come hither, young lovers, hither to the Glade this day.
On towards that patch of clovers,
Amongst those clovers ye both shall lay.

Off with ye, those of roaming heart,
So ye may meet again in the Faerie's Glade.
Take care that thy love be true, for it is sad to part
A love such as this, a love severed by Quarrel's Blade.

So come hither, young Aisling flowers,
May you be forever joined by Faerie Powers.
May this love be a love ne'er ending,
For upon ye this day, blessings the Fae be sending.

_Deoch 21_
