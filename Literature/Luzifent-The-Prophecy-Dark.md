# The Prophecy Dark

Through the streets of Rucesion he furiously strode  
in his mind was what the portents bode.  
By his failure to arrive and intervene  
in an early grave would rest his sweet Ilene.  
Under his brow his eyes didst profusely weep  
in recognition of her impending eternal dark sleep.  
Above his sword his hand didst shakingly hover  
in desperate rage at the fate of his lover.  
Upon an altar most sgriotic she is laid to rest  
in preparation for a powerful dark behest.  
Beside a symbol of evil eternal and deep  
in hopes of raising Chadul from it's sleep.  
By his failure to arrive and intervene  
in an early grave would rest his sweet Ilene.  
Through the streets of Rucesion he furiously strode  
in his mind was what the portents bode.
