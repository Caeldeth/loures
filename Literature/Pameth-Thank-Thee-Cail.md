# Thank Thee, Cail

_by PAMETH of **Dark Ages**_

For every day my thanks I give  
To thee  
FOR EACH CHANCE YOU GIVE TO ME  
I thank thee for the air we breathe  
I thank thee for the green in which thee sheathe  
Our tree, and bush, and blade  
I thank thee for the beauty o' the faerie glade  
Where health for aisling I derive  
I thank thee for the chance to give  
To others health and faith and life  
I thank thee for AID to ease an aisling's strife.  
I THANK THEE FOR THE CHANCE  
FOR AISLING LIFE I CAN ENHANCE  
AND WHERE 'ERE I GO I WISH TO GIVE  
MY THANKS TO THEE  
MY LIFE TO LIVE  
THANK THEE, CAIL
