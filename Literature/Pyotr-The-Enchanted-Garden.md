# The Enchanted Garden

_by Pyotr of **_Dark Ages**_  

Here beneath the betony, hydele,  
And personaca bushes let us lay  
Our humble bread and wine. Then I'll repell  
The hungry mantises so ye can play  
A lyric worthy of the vanished fae,  
A lyric to accompany the swell  
Of bee-buzzed breeze, to burnish golden day  
(one that might quell the heretics shrill yell)  

What, irony? Forgive me, love, I'll hold.  
Yes, seal my mouth with honey from your kiss.  
Don't listen to that viper's passing hiss,  
Acknowledgement will make the timid bold  
So give me leave, my love, to sheathe my sword  
And I do promise I shan't breathe a word.
