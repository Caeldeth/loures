# A Maiden's Tale

_This is not a love story; but a story about love._ \- Bonnie


## Chapter I

Deep down the Mileth Crypts \- unreachable by light - hideous creatures crawl
abroad. The damp atmosphere complimented the heavy odor of waste, not to
mention slime on every wall, between every tile. She sits alone in the dark,
like every other day, in this place that she now calls home. She has no memories
of anything; all but that haunting feeling of hatred and the sense of search
for a certain something. Her long and graceful fingers traced along her face;
soft, pale and delicate skin was the idea of perfection among the Aisling eye.
Arising, her skin-tight clothes mirrored her flawless figure - every curve a man
desires, every gesture - existed in her. Above all, her distinct aroma hovers in
the air; enough to seduce both men and women. Every strand of her dark lilac
hair flows freely, containing the essence of the fragrance - lively lavender
- smooth as silk.

## Chapter II

“Tamailt!” -the ritual greeting every morning from her mother. "Scrub the
floors, wash every sheet and make breakfast for the fourth room!" Runa, the
innkeeper shouted at the top of her lungs.

Tamailt rose quickly from the closet space that made up her room, eyes full of
fear. She knew that the halls were scrubbed only two days ago, still shining
like a reflection on a clear lake. And out of the ten rooms of her mother's
inn, only one was occupied in the past three days. Business has been slow in
this town of Abel, since the new town of Rucesion opened up. But she moved
swiftly, making her way from the back door to the kitchen for the adventurer's
meal.

Rough and textured hands held the wooden plate firmly. Tamailt knocked on the
door of the fourth room; a dashing, handsome young man answered the knock. He
moaned and stretched, attempting to chase the sleep away as Tamailt watched
with fascination. She's never seen such a sight: an attractive and muscular man
at ease in front of her. She blushed, handed him his breakfast tray, and paced
away in a hurry. The young Aisling smiled and chuckled at her reactions, then
whispered under his breath, nodded, as if deciding something important.

Tamailt then found out after the summer that the young man was a monk at
training named Kaind. The impression he gave Tamailt suggested that he has had
quite a bit of adventure and insight in the Aisling world, leaving Tamailt
longing for voyage more and more.

"A pigeon mail!?" Runa squealed with delight. A mail usually means more
business when one works in an inn.

"For Tamailt??" She squealed again, this time eyeing her daughter with
suspicion.

Tamailt tilt her head with confusion, and handled the mail with caution. She
hid for privacy as she opens the mail with butterflies in her stomach; this is
the first sign of existence of her, no one in her memory has even asked for her
name. The hands of the young girl of 15 shook with anticipation as she reads
with difficulty:

> _My Dear Tamailt,_
>
> _I am Kaind, an Aisling looking for expeditions. I have stayed in thy inn by
> chance in my journey in the summer, and it seems like I will be visiting once
> more. I will look forward on meeting you again._

With such a simple note, Tamailt's heart pounded with an unknown feeling of
excitement, like something's soon to happen.

## Chapter III

The anticipated day finally came, when the young and ever more handsome monk
revisited the little inn. The place suddenly felt busier and full of life.
Kaind greeted Tamailt with a polite smile, but enough to startle her for the
whole day; what was the purpose of his mail, she wondered? Disappointment arose
in her; inside, she laughs with mockery at herself. Who did she think she was,
to capture the heart or even the slightest interest in an honorable Aisling?
Tamailt's misery amplified increasingly when Kaind announced his leave after
merely 3 days, so she heard from her mother. Sighs would not help with the
situation; Tamailt can only try to keep her thoughts hidden from others to
avoid embarrassment. After all, her name says it all: "resentment" in the old
tongue. She was born to resent everything that is of this world, to be resented
and to resent others - she does not deserve happiness.

Kaind waved goodbye. Upon his empty room, Tamailt searched for bits of
memories that she could maybe take with her. "For what?" she asked herself.
"Only to be reminded of how stupid and naive I was?" And with this, the corner
of her eye picked on a little piece of paper hidden on the bottom of Kaind's
pillow. A note! Her eyes widened, and although her mind would not allow her
to, her heartbeat raced on:

> _My Sweet Tamailt_,

> _Be in my company to-night, under the holy moonlight of the nearby
> port._

"What could this mean?" Tamailt thought to herself. Was her first judgment
correct after all? Kaind has not abandoned her and was to take her along in his
breathtaking journeys! Still half dazed, Tamailt ran back to her room and sat
in wonder, imagining the night. "Mother cannot possibly know about this," she
whispered to herself. "She'll never agree! She will only stand in the way of my
only chance of happiness!" The exhilaration of belonging and being wanted
filled Tamailt's heart, and suddenly, she was ready for any obstacles that were
to come.

Night followed the glorious day, and settled itself upon Temuair. Tamailt snuck
outside, feeling the cool autumn breeze brush up on her thin build. She
shuddered, and paced with hurry to the south of the town - the port. The strong
silhouette of a young man presented itself in front of Tamailt's eyes, she
slowed down; and tapped gently on the shoulders of the man, afraid to cause
alarm. Kaind turned around and smiled: it felt as if a giant weight has been
lifted from Tamailt's chest, now that everything's all right.

"Hello Tamailt." Kaind smiled again, and wrapped his arms around
her. She shivered at the contact, blushed intensely, and managed to smile.

"It's okay,” his smile made the world stop spinning - "We're together now."
There they stood for the rest of the night, enjoying the beauty of the waters
and the night sky. For the first time in her life, Tamailt felt secure, and
even with so little words, Kaind would understand her. Suddenly, the world
makes sense - and her future appeared to be shining brightly. She fell asleep
in his arms.

Just before the crack of dawn, Tamailt was woken up by Kaind's
gentle caress and murmurs. "Time to go," he whispered to her ears.

"No - Not yet..." She snuggled up even tighter, and giggled at her child like
behavior.

"Then come with me," the smile, mischievous but sincere. Tamailt opened her
eyes abruptly, not able to believe what she had just heard - "Not just a
joke??" she turned around to look at him in his eyes.

"Never." With that, her heart flew into the skies, ready to burst with
happiness: "Oh...oh! I love you so much, Kaind! I'll go pack now! Right away!"
She skipped contentedly back to the inn, and not thinking one bit more, she
packed the little that she had, and left the place that has occupied the last
15 Deoches of her Mundane life.

## Chapter IV

On the road with Kaind, Tamailt felt complete; he has taken good care of her,
and she in turn took great care of him. They traveled the lands from the port
of Abel through Rucesion, and everywhere from there. She sees themselves as any
ordinary pair of lovers, conquering the beasts one by one, and gaining insights
together. Although when encountering many other Aislings, Tamailt has always
felt more insignificant as they do not greet her the same way they greet Kaind.
Though this had bothered her, Tamailt would not let anything distract her from
Kaind - but deep inside, tiny bugs of insecurity has troubled her. Would Kaind
ever fall out of love with her, and realize that he deserved someone much
better, with status?

Two Deoches has passed by: the couple never had much to say, but
Tamailt felt satisfied with that. They have never had any disagreements, since
Tamailt had always agreed with Kaind's every word. To her, her whole life
could be lived so simply as this, the never-ending voyages with all kinds of
things to learn. But what she didn't realize was - Kaind was changing inside.
The long silences soon bored him; Tamailt was nothing but a servant. He was
looking for thrill, new women that would act differently when she hears
something that she didn't like - someone that had their own opinions on things.
A woman, that knows how to please; but more in more way than of a mother.

Kaind started to stay out late at night, rarely resting in the same room as
Tamailt - she followed him out one evening; followed him from the lake of
Undine to the town of Suomi. Admiring his shadows by the candlelight, her face
suddenly twisted with disbelief. Tears fell as rain, and rolled down her cheeks
as chains of pearl. Tamailt ran away with disgust in her stomach, back in
Undine she cried her heart out. Rage intertwined with a sense of something
lost, trust perhaps - It was the most repulsive image that she has ever seen,
Kaind with another woman: a prettier girl than she; a priestess with brown,
curly hair, cuddling up to Tamailt's so-called lover, kissing his lips and
stroking his hair. Kaind on the other hand, reacted in the same way. Lust that
Tamailt has never seen before in Kaind revealed in front of her own eyes.

After Tamailt had no more tears to shed, she dragged herself around Undine,
ignoring the beautiful sceneries and the cold weather. A dark essence slowly
brewed itself in Tamailt, slowly leading her to the dark wizard of Undine
- Kiril. Tamailt has heard of the power of Kiril before, using the dark to
achieve his goals; but Tamailt could not care less what she does to accomplish
her purpose, Kaind has finally discarded her. A wish grows in her mind, a
devious deed.

Kiril was frantically looking for something; Tamailt sat by the researcher's
desk, and sobbed sporadically. Without looking up, his voice rang with
annoyance: "What do you want?! I am not here for comfort! If it is consolation
that you need, get out of my dwelling. You are making this place darker than
ever!"

"I am looking for revenge." Tamailt's voice shivered at the sound of the
unholy word." Will you help me?? She asked.

Kiril seemed to appear as a phantasm, stopped with his work and stared
straight at Tamailt. His voice settled: "What are you willing to give up for
your purpose? It needs to be something of value."

"Anything." she replied without hesitation. What has she got to lose now? She's
already given up everything. Tamailt thought she saw the dark phantasm smile a
little.

"Anything? How about giving me what I was looking for?" the phantasm's voice
became a delighted ring. "I was looking for some memories of another Aisling,
that has requested something of me. I seemed to have lost it; maybe you can
give me yours for my experiment."

"My memory?" she thought to herself. "But then I wouldn't be able to remember
Kaind! And what a traitor he was? Oh? What am I thinking? Of course I wouldn't
want to remember him anymore!"

"Agreed." She decided. "But I have to ask, I still wish to have the memory of
my plans." So with this, Kiril laughed an echo; Tamailt fell dizzily to the
ground.

## Chapter V

In her unconsciousness, she dreamt a dream. Kiril asked her in his phantasm
voice: "What is it that you wish?"

"Revenge," she replied. "I want to be magnificently beautiful - and capture his
heart..." she drifted off to sleep again, but only after hearing that haunting and
echoing laugh of the dark wizard.

"You have a strong willpower; there will be revenge. But be careful, the spell
will become a curse if you do not use it right..." he whispered ghastly.

## Chapter VI

Her head ached when she awoke. Tamailt shook violently as she tried to steady
herself; standing tall, she leaned against a settlement. Opening her eyes
slowly, she looks about. Where was she? Her mind searched frantically for an
answer, but draws only a blank. Hunger stroke, and she paced about wearily
finding pieces of crumbled bread and herbs to eat. As she paused by the lake
for water, something struck her as peculiar. Who was that staring back at her
in the reflection? Red blush in the cheeks, golden-fleeced like hair flowing
freely - crimson red lips, as sweet as honey. Skin that might just break upon
contact, eyes as blue as the day sky. She was beautiful.

A sudden feeling of hatred suddenly arose in Tamailt, filling every inch of her
body ?she knew what she has set out to do. She didn't know why, but the strong
impulse of an action demanded her to move, find the man: seduce him, and break
his heart. Tamailt walked back to where the campsite was, and waited for Kaind.

When it was almost mid-day, Kaind arrived back to the campsite. A smile still
apparent on his face, he stopped in query of a blonde admirable on his
property.

"Good morrow to you, miss. Are you looking for something?" as usual,
he smiled that mischievous smile.

Tamailt turned away in horror from the smile, but soon recovered herself as she
remembered what she has to do. "Yes, indeed I am! I have heard of a great
lover, present here - in Undine. Here I look upon the lover, but am not
impressed. What have you got to offer?" she looked up with her innocent eyes,
batting at his soul. Kaind looked in bewilderment; he has never seen anyone as
wondrous as her.

"A great lover?" he chuckled. "If I had a reputation like that,
Maeie would just kill me..." he whispered to himself.

"Maeie? And who would that be?" more anger emerged in Tamailt, a
voice inside her cried out for recognition.

"Oh, nobody. Would you like something to eat then, my lady?" Her
beauty has caught Kaind off guard, leaving him as bold as a newborn chick.

## Chapter VII

Tamailt and Kaind traveled together for a Moon; in that time, Kaind
has never left Tamailt alone. Maeie was the last thing on his mind, as Kaind
tries his best to impress the new girl. After a Moon more, Kaind's frenetic
attempts into nothingness have pushed him to confront Tamailt.

"Why won't you love me, my sweet? You wouldn't even tell me your
name. I love you so" he played with her strands of velvet-like hair, tired
from a double Moon's sleepless nights.

"You cannot have me," she replied bleakly. "You do not deserve
anyone." After a pause, she turned to Kaind. A click went inside her, and a
voice: "It's time."


"You are a traitor, Kaind. You are not worthy of something as
sacred as love. You do not know what it means. Tell me, who is Tamailt? Who is
Maeie? You don't even remember, do you? They're just items of affection,
_things_ that you can temporarily vent on. From now on, you will suffer
the same!" Tamailt's fury was released onto Kaind; smokes of darkness filled
the air, and a magnificent clap of thunder.

## Chapter VIII

The voice inside screamed. Screamed as a million knives were
stabbed into it, carving it open and exposing the insides. Tamailt could not
bear the pain: her shrieks pierced the sky, traveling far into the
traveler's and Mundane's ears - the children cried, the man and women looked upon
the sky as clouds of gloom covered the bright light. Tamailt's face became
distorted, eventually breaking down as darkness surrounds her.

The shrieking had stopped. Kaind shivered with fear as the black clouds in
front of him depart the blonde beauty he had once known. He tried to talk, but
could not hear a word - he tried to scream, but still nothing; he has lost his
sense of hearing.

Legs stepped out the smoke, pale and delicate as before. Soon, the hips,
arms - more staggering than the previous: she is indeed perfect. Her hair has
changed into a dark violet, her lips with hues of purple, and her eyes as dark
as the night itself. The contrast between her skin and the darkness are with
such distinctness, she didn't seem human.

"Tamailt?" watched Kaind cry with distress, and still unable to listen to his
own voice. She looked on with no emotion; the voice inside was satisfied. She
walked away, now with nothing on her shoulders, she traveled the lands.

## Chapter IX

Those who have looked upon her are to be left speechless. Her exquisiteness
made the people afraid, fear of unknown and the great. Tamailt felt nothing,
said nothing, but simply walked away.

This day, she had boarded a ship of Rucesion to Abel by chance. It was night
when she arrived, and she looked for the inn. Upon her entrance to the inn, the
voice inside returned; and seemed to whimper. The innkeeper was a frantic
woman, and called herself Runa - she asks every Aisling that approaches to cure
her sick child. Tamailt sensed some familiarity from this woman; she asked to
see the child.

Runa hesitated for a minute, then said in a hushed voice: "I will let you see
her, but you mustn't let her notice. She's quite fragile, that young girl..."
her voice trailed off as she paced busily up the stairs of the inn.

Runa led Tamailt into the biggest room of the inn, and pointed at the empty
bed. "There she is, you can have a look at her, then maybe help me find a cure
for her." She backed away, and left the room.

Tamailt looked on the vacant space, decorated with the best furniture - she
studied the area with detail, and found old diaries on which the voice inside
whimpered even more. Tamailt returned to Runa, and asked: "What is the name of
this daughter of yours?"

"Tamailt," Runa replied. "She is quite sick, no? Please? I will offer you goods
if you can cure her." Runa cried in distress.

A shock hit Tamailt, and all the emotion of hate, regret, abandonment and grief
returned to her; it was too much, too much to abide and to realize the love of
her mother existed for her. She had caused her mother to think of her child as
sick than a runaway - insanity drove her abnormal.

Tamailt ran out of the inn, to wherever her feet carried her. The voice of Runa
behind her echoed in her mind: "Save Tamailt for me! Please!"

## Chapter X

Tamailt had found herself in Mileth, an old town at the very north
of Temuair. She ran past the eyes of wonderers, with all the old emotions
coming back at her stronger than before - swallowing her whole. She eyed a dark
crypt, erect with young Aislings venturing abroad. Not thinking twice, she
pushed her way swiftly down the crypts, level by level - each area darker,
more damp and frightening than the previous. When she finally stopped, she
found the creatures staring back at her, ready to strike. Her confusion
reacted with her strong willpower, and sent the monsters flying to walls;
others then backed off, and left her alone.

Tamailt wanted to cry, but she did not know why. Here in the dark
crypts she stayed, and the calmer she becomes after time has passed. When one
day, a young monk with his hunting group traveled deep into the crypt and
encountered Tamailt. Tamailt raised her head, stared him right in the eyes.
Something clicked inside her, madness like before came wave after wave - the
sight of a striking woman confused the young monk; but before he could react,
Tamailt attacked him. Her eyes shone as bright lights, and wished him dead.
The young monk did not know what hit him, no monster was near him and his
group; after a few attacks, the Aislings realized that the girl - or creature,
rather - that shows itself as a beautiful female was indeed dangerous. They ran
away in fear, leaving Tamailt alone again. The waves resided, and she is once
again, calm.

Day after day, Tamailt found herself losing more and more of her.
She felt drained away, where in fact - she was duplicating. Her willpower
became so strong that she felt the need to make more of herself to search for
something that the voice inside was telling her to. What was it? She will
never know. The feeling of hatred would arise again and again whenever she
sees an Aisling. But also when she sees an Aisling, she feels found. Found the
need to destroy, and search again.

Aislings call her the Succubus, the evil beauty that search and
destroys every Aisling. She fights with psychic powers, and must be bewared
of.

Note: Kiril, the phantasm will later unearth the Aosdic scroll, which the
Dwarf, Torgny has given him. The scroll is of the legend of ascension, which
is linked to the Succubus. Kiril has never realized the effects that his power
had had over Tamailt; the coincidence of Kiril unearthing the scroll (which
lead to massive killing of the Succubus) can only be seen _as_ a coincidence.

This is only a maiden's tale, which the Aislings have told of about the
Succubus. She is a mystery, which all of Temuair are curious to know.
