# On the Steps of the Temple of Deoch

_by Clockwork of **Dark Ages**_

The Dreamers' Mass has ended  
the temple returns to the mundane laity  
and we file from this grand church  
an army of heroes and poets,  
laughing and talking  
returning to our homes and hunting grounds  
The wide-eyed children of Suomi are here  
whispering and pointing  
They've come to see the Aislings  
the fierce and splendid champions  
their rich embroidered robes  
their glittering weapons  
The children stare and giggle  
as the throng of supermen streams down the steps  
diverging into twos and threes  
grouping into their factions and cliques  
but  
I am alone  

I remember this temple empty and ruined  
We played here, my Beloved and I,  
the clockmaker's daughter and the servants' son  
when we were only children  
no taller than these,  
hiding between the dusty broken pews of the great hall  
chasing each other through dim passages  
staring at the ruined friezes depicting pagan rituals  
drunken orgies to the god of debauchery  
We were so innocent, my Beloved and I  
in those days before the gods returned  
and before the Advent of the Dreamers  

O, great stones of the temple do you remember my beloved?  
Do you remember her laughter pealing through this vast stone hall?  

I remember stolen kisses  
We did not yet know those years had become Deochs,  
when we were the clockmaker's apprentice and his daughter  
Our love was still bright and new  
on that day  
when everything changed  
the day the first Aislings came to Suomi  
We watched them, my Beloved and I,  
their grand entry  
pennants and banners snapping in the breeze  
the serene monk, the scowling wizard, and  
the beautiful, proud warrior  
(she smiled when she saw us watching)  
they rode past us on their mighty warhorses  
their retinue of mundanes marching proudly behind  
toward the town hall  
and  
after that day our parents would speak  
in hushed tones,  
of dark incursions from unholy realms  
strife amongst the gods  
and the thin line of light holding back the darkness  

O, great stones of the temple, do you regret the loss of devotion so profound?  
Do you mourn for our great passion felled in its full bloom?  

I remember the call, the terrible, beautiful call  
a chorus of a thousand angels screaming in my head  
calling me to Mileth  
demanding to be answered  
I left my master without a thought, forsaking my trade  
I cast away my family  
I betrayed my friends  
and I abandoned my Beloved  
to reach for that prized pearl  
the precious spark  
I remember fever-dreams of ancient gods, on my journey  
a storm-tossed ship  
a kind priest who fed me  
the beating the soldiers gave me  
and then there was my Beloved, my beautiful Beloved,  
with me on my journey  
I do not know where she found me, or when  
only that she was there  
steadying me  
when I stumbled through the gates of the city  
along the avenues  
until I reached the battered hotels of the poor  
and finally collapsed  
to be reborn  

They think I am so fearless  
when I go to meet the lumbering horde  
when I battle the twisted minions of the enemy  
when I descend into the crypts  
They sing now of my glorious bravery  
my endless war against the darkness  
If they only knew  
how I long for the enemy's welcome embrace  
to be torn from this world  
to be hurtled through the aether  
to spend a few hours in the sinister realm  
for a few moments, to be complete  
I never wanted more than the tradesman's life  
a simple home, enough for my Beloved and I, a few children...  
the finery of the Aislings, the disciplines of the monks  
these calloused hands  
accustomed to killing  
are strange and empty to me  
The clock-maker's apprentice is so far gone now;  
only I remain  
his scarred soldier of light  
trapped in the labyrinth of Temuair  

O, ancient temple,  
long-forgotten cathedral of the Light-Bringer,  
Your finery has been restored  
Plush velvet tapestries from Rucesion  
Intricate facades repaired by the master stoneworkers of Loures  
New pews carved by the woodworkers of Mileth  
After the long centuries, the priests have replenished your congregations  
Gathered your worshippers back from the wilderness  
Your god has returned home,  
burning brightly with newfound redemption  
O, great stones of the temple  
do you pity me?  
You have regained your soul  
and I have lost mine  

I remember the warm summer air  
thick with the sweet, cloying scent of the Garden  
I remember the lutes of the musicians  
and sharing a tankard of hot, spicy wine  
deep in the woodlands, at the Celebration of Glioca  
on the night my Beloved died  
I was so eager for acceptance  
the novice monk and his Mundane lover  
so desperate for the blessing  
of Aisling society's elite  
I was bright with my new power, giddy in the full bloom of our love  
I remember kissing her cheek by the fire  
as we listened to the old epic songs  
then  
suddenly  
the blood-curdling scream of a child  
and then they were upon us  
huge dark forms loping into the clearing  
the strangled battle-cries of the goblins filling the air  
mixed with the terrified cries of celebrants  
fleeing into the trees  
I stood fast with my brothers  
shouting our cries -- tzaaii! tzaaii!  
leaping through the air  
battering the monsters with kicks and punches  
we fought so fiercely, my brothers and I!  
but  
for every one killed,  
three more came  
until,  
one  
by  
one  
we began to fall  

I remember crawling, with both of my legs broken  
at the end of the battle  
through the perfumed plants  
searching  
until I found her  
crumpled and bleeding  
I do not know if she was already dead then  
or soon would be  
I held her in my arms, and wept  
she was so beautiful, through tear-blurred eyes  
I kissed her,  
one final kiss  
tasting bruised lips, broken teeth  
and then they found me  
the wicked brutes of the forest  
I remember  
being yanked into the air  
hot, rancid breath  
yellow-fanged maw closing on my shoulder  
wrenching my arm away  
watching the wretched beasts rip the meat from it  
crack the bone, suck the marrow  
as the cold twilight enveloped me  
and then  
strange turning, hot, intoxicated half-sleep  
hurtling between the realms towards the faraway light  
turning again  
until  
I was standing  
my body transfigured, angelic, mute  
my beloved beside me there  
in the realm of the shadows  
the terrible resonance of the great chamber of souls  
singing with dark power -- yet silent  
the great, rotting form of the Attendant regarding us  
pointing his skeletal finger at me  
and then I was hurtled again, back through the aether  
to my resurrection  
in Temuair  

O, great stones of the temple, how can I unfold this gnarled heart?  
Where is the key that unlocks the tragic accord?  
How long must I wait for the cruel, glowering sun to pass beneath that distant horizon?  
When will I regain my lost soul?  

How many times have I slipped from this bright world  
fled from Danaan's hot gaze  
to that shadowy realm?  
every time she is waiting there  
gazing at me in mute sorrow  
so silent, so sad, so beautiful  
until the bony finger points  
the compact of the League of Darkness is honored  
and I am restored to the living earth;  
the conscript of the gods returned once more to their chosen battleground  
the pawn returned to his rank  
O, great stones of the temple,  
how long must I search?  
When will I find the answer to this riddle?  
I have deciphered the ancient scrolls of the great Library of Loures  
translated the lore of the Mukul  
interpreted the hieroglyphic walls of the Temple of Veil  
And  
the Pact cannot be broken  
I am no closer to escaping this sunlit labyrinth  
Deoch's Gift has bound me to this living world  
so gloomy, so barren to me now  
When shall I break this cruel cycle, and slip finally into the welcoming night?  
When will I become whole again?  

I am alone now,  
alone on the steps of the temple of Deoch  
the last mundane priest smiles and nods as he hurries past  
leaving me to my thoughts  
the sun is high in the sky now  
and the children of Suomi are long gone  
only I remain  
and the brutal, silent stones of the temple
