# Zoei's Quest

_By Zoei of **Dark Ages**_

_These 6 entries tell the life of Zoei, through essay and prose, and her
search for love in Temuair. She posted them to the Mileth Community
Bulletin Board, over a period of about 1 Deoch._

## The Quest

Today I laid to rest my ghosts! I have accepted the fact that my husband is
gone. Possibly even dead, and will never return. My heart was heavy with grief,
as I caste a wreath into the calm waters of the canal here in Mileth, allowing
the gentle current to float the brightly coloured vessel to the sea of Abel, as
a token of my love and loyalty to an Aisling of great courage and passion,
whose warmth and love for me, had kept away the winter's chill at night, and
filled my days with sunshine. And, yet strangely. my heart was also lightened,
for now I shall start my life anew. travelling upon the paths of Temuair, as if
I were reborn. enjoying the company and hospitality of my friends, the
unexpected pleasure of making new acquaintances, in the fragile hope of meeting
that special someone, who will once again fill my life with laughter, bring
hope and joy to my days, and nights of tenderness and passion, as I lie in his
arms.

So. this is my Quest. A journey I must make on my own, until the day an Aisling
stands at my side, loyal in his love and generous in his heart. I know you are
there, and I shall find you. no matter how distant you be, or how arduous the
journey.

## The Journey

My journey began in the dark of night
The howl of ghosts, in the chill, did fright
As through the streets of Mileth I ran
To seek the light, so my journey began

The paths they lead through many perils
To bring face to face, my inner devils
The call was loud and strong to me
And lead me to the depths of hidden Soumi

The journey back has been slow, a dream
Through Undine's fields and Sapphire Stream
Past waters blue and field of green
My eyes fill with the wonders I've seen

I met upon this journey great
A lonely Aisling, call it fate
As if in some long ago dream, a fable
We stood and whispered on the cobbles of Abel

He held my hands and said such words
Of love and life, and set-free birds
And as the words washed over me
So came the light to set me free

The dawning of day, the awakening of love
As fragile and timid as a frightened dove
The rays of hope did touch my heart
To bring to me a brand new start

And although my journey is not at an end
Today I have a new found friend
Whose promise of loyalty, did bring a tear
Along with joy, to caste out the fear

## A Mystery

_Of all the mysteries, this is the greatest and most puzzling._

Of all the mysteries that I now know
Time will pass and the truth finally show
About an Aisling known as "da Fyn"
And why Zoei's attracted to him

'Tis a puzzle in all truth, I confess
For the God's could not honestly bless
Such a match, surely they snicker and laugh
To see this couple follow this arduous path

The Fyn is a true Rogue, through and through
With wandering eye and sneaky hand, too
But there is something about this real scamp
That Zoei sees, to call him her "champ"

It cannot be the way that he talks
Or the odd limp, in his stride, as he walks
Nor the offer of posies or roses
More like horseradish, to hold to their noses

If we are speaking of flowery bouquets
The Fyn has his own special ways
Of skirting around the subject quite neat
Of "umming" and "erring", and shuffling his feet

"Romantic" is not his strongest suit
But nor is he bullish, or ever a brute
His needs are quite simple, plain, even sweet
And his eyes shine so brightly whenever they meet

So, although this mystery remains yet unsolved
Take heed, I suggest, don't get involved
Zoei will continue to offer her love
While da Fyn, will answer, "Aye, yer me duv"

## New Day

As I stand amidst the fields of green
Lazy daisies, bob their heads, at my feet
My eyes caress the mountains, afar
As they stand as sentinels, the new day to greet

The flowers which bloom, fill the air with their scent
While a bird on the wing, twitters and sings
And as the days pass, with my love at my side
The joy of this world, fill my heart with such things

And like the mountains, I greet the new day
With a song on my lips and hope in my heart
I offer my hand to the one known as Fyn
As we travel together, and make our new start

## The Sharpest Knife

The lies, deceit, the cheating
In the betrayal of a trust
Love so briefly fleeting
And a knife so deeply thrust

She turns her smile upon him
Draws him deep inside her web
He forgets the promise once made me
All the plans we made and said

So, I welcome that blade of steel
Plunge it deep inside my heart
To stop the pain I'm now feeling
Since my love and I, were torn apart


## In Closing

The soft caress of a lonely tear
As it rolls gently, down my cheek
The searing burn inside my breast
Of secret words, too timid to speak
A heart which now, so slowly beats
To the rhythm of love gone wrong
As the words fade, and echo away
At the sad close, of our love song
