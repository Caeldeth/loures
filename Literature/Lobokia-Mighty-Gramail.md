# Mighty Gramail

_By Lobokia in **Dark Ages**_

I arise to-day  
Through a mighty strength, the invocation of the allies three  
Through belief in the oneness  
Of the Creator of Order  

I arise to-day  
Through the strength of Gramail's creation  
Through the strength of His Laws  
Through the strength of His Godness with his ascension  

I arise to-day  
Through the strength of the love of Gramail  
In obedience of angels  
In the service of archangels  
In hope of resurrection to meet with reward  
In prayers of patriarchs  
In predictions of prophets  
In preachings of apostles  
In deeds of righteous men  
In protection of the law  

I arise to-day  
Through the strength of heaven  
Light of the sun  
Radiance of the moon  
Splendour of fire  
Speed of lightning  
Swiftness of wind  
Depth of the sea  
Stability of earth  
Firmness of rock  

I arise to-day  
Through Gramails laws to pilot me  
Gramails might to uphold me  
Gramails wisdom to guide me  
Gramails eye to look after me  
Gramails ear to hear me  
Gramails words to speak for me  
Gramails hand to guard me  
Gramails shield to protect me  
From snares of vices  
From temptation of succubae  
From everyone one who shall wish me ill afar and near  
Alone and in multitude  

I summon to-day all these powers  
Against every power that may oppose my body and soul  
Against incantations of false prophets  
Against black laws of pagandom  
Against false laws of heretics  
Against spells of woman and smiths and wizards  
Against every knowledge that corrupts man's body and soul  

Gramail to shield me to-day  
Against poison, against burning  
Against drowning, against wounding  
So that there come to me abundance of reward  
Gramail with me, Gramail before me, Gramail behind me  
Gramail on my right, Gramail on my left  
Gramail in the heart of every man who thinks of me  
Gramail in the mouth of every one who speaks of me  
Gramail in every eye that sees me  
Gramail in every ear that hears me  

I arise to-day  
Through a mighty strength, the invocation of the allies three  
Through belief in the oneness  
Of the Creator of Order  

_Dedicated to my mentor Angel_
