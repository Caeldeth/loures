# The Ballad of the Blushing Barmaid

_by Kaeyhari of **Dark Ages**_

East of the Streets of Abel,  
And North of the Woodland Hills,  
Lies the bussl'n tavern o Mileth,  
Where all men may drink their fills!

Oh Kallach's a sword'n training,  
And Dar's a cast'n spells,  
But Daithi that rascally rat faced rogue,  
Is at the bar, a seek'n his thrills! **__

Chorus:

_Oh! Duana dance m'gal! Duana twirl!  
Tickle that 'ol roguish heart with  
The flutter of ye red dress frills!  
Oh! Duana twinkle your eyes! Duana smile!  
'Ol Daithi's a chas'n ya, seeking a kiss!  
T'would be yer blush'n all the while!_

A roguish heart's a cunn'n one,  
And his wits are e'er sly!  
So round the tables, 'ol Daithi he runs,  
With the love 'o Duana's Red dress frills  
A beam'n in his eye!

"Nay to ya!, Ye rat faced man!" laugh she,  
"And be keep'n yer hands to ye'self!"  
"For I'm a quick 'n spry bright maid!"  
But 'ol Daithi jus' laughs, 'n gives her a kiss!  
Grin'n his roguish self!

Chorus:

_Oh! Duana dance m'gal! Duana twirl!  
Tickle that 'ol roguish heart with  
The flutter of ye red dress frills!  
Oh! Duana twinkle your eyes! Duana smile!  
'Ol Daithi's a chas'n ya, seeking a kiss!  
T'would be yer blush'n all the while!_

A blushing and a laugh'n, round the tables  
The maid 'n the rogue do go!  
Daithi catches her hand 'n kisses her there!  
A searching for a rest'n place  
That red dress girl's a runn'n to slow!

"Stop!" says bright Duana "I'm all tired 'o this dance!"  
"I'll give you a kiss!" laughs she, a grin'n,  
'N stops 'ol Daithi, with a bursh ' her lips!  
Now look'e here, who's blush'n?  
'Ol Daithi, his head 'a spinn'n!_

Chorus:

_Oh! Duana dance m'gal! Duana twirl!  
Tickle that 'ol roguish heart with  
The flutter of ye red dress frills!  
Oh! Duana twinkle your eyes! Duana smile!  
'Ol Daithi's a chas'n ya, seeking a kiss!  
T'would be yer blush'n all the while! _

(Ballad slows to speaking tune)** _

Now what ya s'pose come of this?  
Our rogue 'n maid pursuit?  
Did brave 'ol Daithi, receive 'er kiss?  
Or did the maid up 'n give 'im the boot?  
Ah! For 'n answer thus, mi friends!  
Ye need only turn ye gaze!  
T'word that cozy little cottage, a yonder'.  
'.where'. _(Ballad picks up tempo)_  
'Ol Daithi's a kiss'n a blushing red dressed miss,  
And twelve rogue'n child'ns a skipp'n 'n dancing!  
'A blush'n all the maids! **_

_(Louder)_

Chorus:

_Oh! Duana dance m'gal! Duana twirl!  
Tickle that 'ol roguish heart with  
The flutter of ye red dress frills!  
Oh! Duana twinkle your eyes! Duana smile!  
'Ol Daithi's a chas'n ya, seeking a kiss!  
T'would be yer blush'n all the while!_
