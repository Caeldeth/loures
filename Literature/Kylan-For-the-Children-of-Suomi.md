# For the Children of Suomi

_by Kylan in **Dark Ages**_

A dark moon rises into the sky.  
A dark moon rises who will be  
the first to die.

They come in ships as black  
as black as night.  
They come in ships to kill tonight.

So as shadows creep up Soumi's shore.  
We go to fight in the Goblin War.

They come by land and by sea so  
bring ye arms and fight with me.

Stand together and unite as one  
and this war shall be won.
