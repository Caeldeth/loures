# Ceannlaidir Prays

In these five years serving my great father Ceannlaidir and observing other
followers, I noticed some curiosities in the way which one says his or her
prayers.

Talking with several of them I captured the ideas of each one. It then became
clear that, despite some differences in details, the majority of the prayers
are bound to main facts -- Ceannlaidir's and his followers' qualities -- and
often offer thanks to the God of War.

Having a collection of different prayers, and researching old documents about
Ceannlaidir and his fellowship, I attempted to recreate the original prayers of
our religion.

I hope to have accomplished what I had in mind. The prayers I was able
to reconstruct follow.

## Ceannlaidir Prayer

Oh Glorious Ceannlaidir  
Among the Gods, the bravest  
And this bravery I do reflect  
For you, I fear not death  
To you I sacrifice my body and soul  
Guide me on the road of glories  
Honorably I shall follow it  
Always overcoming my weaknesses  

Give me answers when confusion has me  
Show me the ways if I lose mine  
Guide my hands when I wield my sword  
May my enemies be terrorized at the very image of me  

Among all the things I love  
Among all the things I feel  
Nothing compares to the faith I have  
To you I dedicate all my victories  

For all the things you mean to me  
With pride I call you Father  
Watch over this son who will always love you  
And rest while I honor your name  

## A Warrior's Thanks to Ceannlaidir

When my sword cuts the air  
When I walk over my fallen enemies  
When blood covers my blade  
When victory is in my reach  
You, God of War, I wish to thank  

Following you I never desist  
Nothing would I be without you  
May I always serve you right  
And may I always honor your name  
You, God of War, I wish to thank  

For my strength, my courage, my wits  
For the righteous battles I fought and fight  
For the pride I enclose in my chest  
The pride I have in being your son  
You, God of War, I wish to thank  

The unworthy battle in error  
By your side I fight with Honor  
You grant me Bravery, Glory, Victory  
Protect me, and bring death to my foes  
You, Ceannlaidir, I wish to thank.  

## A Rogue's Prayer to Ceannlaidir

In my shade I see your reflex  
Behind me, guiding my steps  
The Moon and the great Warrior  
God of War, Ceannlaidir  
Your strength you grant me  
Your spoils you give me  
Your skills I carry in me  
Moving swiftly you are with me  
For that I thank you, I have nothing to fear  

All those who dare oppose me  
To Sgrios I send their souls  
Proud I am for fighting in your name  
For each drop of blood I shed in your name  
Protect me, my wealth, my soul  

## Priestly Words with Ceannlaidir

Oh Almighty Ceannlaidir  
Happy I am, for serving you  
Brave I am, for following you  
Fearless I am, for being close to you  
For granting me this gift, I thank you  

If strength fails me, Ceannlaidir,  
Forgive the weakness of this servant  
But look at me and you shall see  
I serve you in my own way  
I honor you with each prey  
I aid my companions slay  

Your road I can never travel, Ceannlaidir  
But your ways always will I follow  
Bearing the strongest of spirits  
Led by the greatest of hearts  
Unparalleled, for following you  

When in battle, let me heal  
And save the lives of those who serve you  
When I fall, be by my side  
Let my body and soul's sacrifice honor you  

Amen.  

## A Monk's Praise to Ceannlaidir

Ave Ceannlaidir, God of War  
Life of the strong, death of the weak, Ave  
For you we pray, outcast sons of Glioca  
For you we slay, in certainty our deeds are right  
In these wastelands you brought us Cail  
Fruit of the union of War and Love  
Today we turn to our patron's father, god of limitless power  
For higher goals to achieve, victory to reach, foes to defeat  

We need no swords, our fists are shaper  
We need no armors, our bodies are stronger  
Skillful as an eagle, merciless as a wolf  
Mirroring your nobility, honoring your name  
Ave, Ceannlaidir, Father of Cail, God of War!  

## A Wizard's Oath to Ceannlaidir

My vigor raises earth  
My knowledge tames water  
My strength controls fire  
My swiftness leads air  
The elements I master I put to your use  
O Great Warrior Ceannlaidir  

If the enemy wishes my death  
The power you grant me shall be my savior  
If Sgrios reaches out to my soul  
My faith in you shall turn his gaze to my foe  
Never will I fear the outcome of battles  
O Great Warrior Ceannlaidir  

In the wars you fought and the wars we fight  
The same purpose  
The cleansing of the land, the selection of the strongest  
Guide my steps so I can be one of the chosen  
For only the strongest will survive the final war  
Only the strongest will stand by your side  
O Great Warrior Ceannlaidir
