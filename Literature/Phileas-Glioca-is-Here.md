# Glioca is Here

_by Phileas in **Dark Ages**_

Welcome, young Aisling, in this calm and holy place  
Come closer my son, and speak to me without fear  
I can see the pain and sadness upon your face  
Do not worry anymore, friend, Glioca is here.

If this is hate that you feel, then praise Glioca  
Your heart will be filled with the Love she spreads, brother  
If this is rage that you feel, then praise Glioca  
And Compassion will make disappear your anger.

So now, blessed, to wherever your travels lead  
Sleeping under a tree, walking with the fairies  
Fighting with courage to help a friend in need  
In your life and in your dreams, Glioca is here.
