# Dark Seduction

_By Seara in **Dark Ages**_

Grey shadows danced on walls where no light fell,  
And darkness lolls  
Whisperin' softly dance with us  
O' dance the dance that time recalls  
Out o' the dark, neath the shadow's sway  
A hand did touch me...bade me stay  
Dance the dance that needs no light  
Nor sanction from the moons dim light  
So I danced.  
O' power deep and darkly strong did sway me to and fro  
Could this be wrong on this I did not know  
The dance went on.  
The shadows led me to a great, amorphous room  
Where skeletal faces leer'd from walls of deepest gloom  
I embraced the song that fell abruptly on me ears  
O' come, it sang, young Aisling, come and lose yer fears  
Be strong it said, the pow'r will entwine  
Be strong it said, and dance, and soon you will be mine  
I danced on  
The lich's song did shroud me in the knowledge from Tagor  
Then he leaned over grinnin', and whisper'd in me ear  
"This pow'r holds a price my child so dance no more".  
And I danced.
