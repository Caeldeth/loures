# Wedding Ceremony

_by Zervus in **Dark Ages**_

_This wedding was choreographed by Zervus Wildfire. i wanted to give my wife
something special that surpassed anything done in temuair. I compile this work,
a written script of our wedding, in honor of Iris Wildfire._

The cast are as follows:

priest: MaX, sgrios priest  

priestess: Talshaya, glioca priest  

Earth: Canadian, creag mage  

fire: Tezrin, srad mage  

air: Torolf, athar mage  

water: Xilan, sal mage  

_the priest and priestess stand before the altar surrounded on each side by the
 elemental holders, they close around us after we approach forming a circle._

**Invocation to the Elements**

_Earth_ : Spirits of Earth, we welcome you to this circle.  

_Fire_ : Spirits of Fire, we welcome you to this circle.  

_Air_ : Spirits of Air, we welcome you to this circle.  

_Water_ : Spirits of Water, we welcome you to this circle.  

**Invocation to the Goddess and God**

_Priestess_ :

*I call to mind the Mother of life   
Who has given us as aislings, her blessings and love  
And with her love, given to us freely, we change the world  
and all living things within it.

_Earth_ : You are Earth, the bones of the World.  

_Water_ : You are Water, the giver of life and the sustainer of dreams.  

_Fire_ : You are Fire, the destructive aspect of us all.  

_Air_ : You are Air; you are the inspiration of the World.  

_Priestess_ :

* Glioca, be welcome here.   
You have bound these hearts together; come into this  
circle where lovers await your blessing!

_Priest_ :

* God of darkness, Sgrios, be with us   
Hunter and hunted, son and sacrifice--  
All that lives takes part in You;  
You are the guide between life and death, the Guardian of the Gate.  

_Earth_ : You are the ripening grain, the Dying God  

_Water_ : You are the crashing waves, destroyer of stone  

_Fire_ : You are the setting sun, the days end  

_Air_ : You are the raging storm, destruction of peace  

_Priest_ : Gods of temuair, we ask you to enter our circle where lovers await
your blessing! Bring your Blessings and your magic into our lives.  

**Handfasting Ceremony**

_Priestess_ : Now the circle is cast, and we stand once more in the space
between the worlds.

_Priest_ : This is the time of joining and sacrifice, of light and darkness.
Here, on the day when balance is sustained, we are gathered to celebrate the
union of the Iris Danesti and Zervus Wildfire.

_Priestess_ (to bride): Are you here of your own free will?

_Priest_ (to groom): Are you here of your own free will?

_(Presumably the answer is yes. )_

_Priest_ (to bride and groom): Are you ready to bind your hearts and your
lives together, to share your joys and burdens, to walk together through life
and death so long as you both shall love?

_(The answer had better be yes! )_

_Priest_: Is there anything you would like to share with eachother before
everyone gathered here?

*vows*

_Priestess_ : This cord binds your hearts and hands together. It is woven in
your chosen colors of red, black and white: red for blood, white for light, and
black for darkness. Thus the balance is sustained in your lives, the darkness
and light binded to you.

*Binds hands in a traditional sign of infinity*

_Priest_: in the eyes of everyone and everything I pronounce you husband and
wife. You may now kiss the bride.

*fun stuff*

_Priestess_: *cuts the cord* although this cord has been cut it's bond remains
for eternity unsevered.

*reception*

For anyone who reads this, i hope that this wedding will be the standard for
all weddings in the future.
