# Father

_by Palleon in **Dark Ages**_

Father,

I write this to you not knowing if I will ever see you again or if this will
even find your kind eyes. My only hope should I die is that an aisling will
find my body and recover the letter and speed it to you. Even now as my party
huddles behind a hideous altar deep within the depths of Cthonic Remains, evil
Dark Clerics seek us out.

Our priest has barely enough faith to keep himself alive much less a party of
four but he is giving it all that he has. I have placed blinding traps all
around us just the way you and Baltazar taught me but I don't know if they will
hold back the mass of Clerics that bears down on us...

Our warrior has gone mad; his rants to his god Ceannlaidir have grown more and
more incessant yet he receives no answer for strength or protection. Fiosachd
has so far helped keep my wits about me but for how much longer I do not know.

The wizard in my group has begun enhancing us and we are preparing to step out
from behind this infernal dark pit of Sgrios into an even darker pit of Hell.
I will pray to Fio so he may veil our advance, giving us an element of surprise.

Gods!!! I hope that we make it, that at least one of us does to recant this tale.

We came here because of a wives tale, a story told to us as children to scare
us into not playing in the forests.

There cannot be pure hy-brasyl guarded by Draco Kings down here.

This place reeks of evil and is infested by it, I feel
infested by it.

How could Kings have lived here? I refuse to hide in the shadows and let my
compatriots look evil face to face alone, if they perish the I will too
alongside of them. So I will set my traps dear father and I will do all I can
to make you and our ancestors proud.

I must make this quick for the rage in my warriors eyes tell me we are about to
attack this hoard.

Give my love to mother, I will see you in the eternal there after.

Your Loving Son

Dear Sir,

It is with deep regret that I send you this.

This letter was found among the remains of 10 Dark Clerics and 4 aislings
during one of my excursions through Cthonic Remains.

It appears your son and his party fought to the end. I found many good traps
placed expertly.

Your son was a well trained rogue and you should be proud.

I hope that these last words from your son bring you some form of comfort in
your sea of grief.
