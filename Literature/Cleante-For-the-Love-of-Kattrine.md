# For the Love of Kattrine

_by Cleante of **Dark Ages**_

I Dream of Rain,  
I Dream of Snow,  
I Dream of that day,  
The First day that I would know,  
My love, my life, and my world...  

It was sunny,  
Bright,  
I shielded my eyes and mumbled,  
"I prefer the night",  
And so I continued on the lonely road...  

I read the sign outside the castle  
So, this is Loures, that's what they call it,  
So this is where Kings Rule,  
And Women Knit,  
It seems so huge, a huge dreamland...  

I Dream of Rain,  
I Dream of Fate,  
I walked into Loures,  
Not a moment too late,  
And there she was...  

Her eyes were a dark green,  
Her hair was a light brown,  
She sat there by the fountain,  
Kicking her legs around,  
My heart jumped, and raced, and fluttered...  

I have never felt like this before,  
But I knew it was love,  
I knew she was a gift,  
Sent from high above,  
She looked like an innocent angel, I still remember...  

I Dream of Rain,  
I Dream of the Sun,  
I walked up to her,  
And knew she was the one,  
"Hi, I'm Kattrine, what's your name?"

Kattrine, such beauty,  
Kattrine, such a beautiful name,  
"My nameâ€™s Cleante..."  
And thus that became,  
The start to a great friendship...  

As the Deochs passed,  
As the days crept bye,  
We were almost always together,  
Kattrine and I,  
I loved her, and she loved me...  

I Dream of Rain,  
I Dream of Her,  
I still can't believe it,  
She was as sweet and soft as a cats purr,  
Why...why did it have to be?  

I came to Loures one day,  
Wearing my new priest coat,  
I brought her an Engagement Ring,  
But I was stopped like an animal, a goat,  
They told me to speak with her mother...  

Her mother told me everything,  
It brought a tear to my eye,  
She has fallen ill, a sickness,  
I couldn't bear it I broke down and started to cry,  
Kattrine...  

I Dream of Rain,  
I Pray for her Health,  
For her I would give it all up,  
My priesthood, my items, my wealth,  
Come back to me Kattrine...  

Now I pray to you,  
Good Aislings, gentle as a dove,  
Please aid me, help her...  
Rekindle her life...and her love...  
Sevti Blossoms is what she needs...  

Now Please,  
Go and help an Angel in need,  
I stand by her side every day and night,  
I wait for the day to place the ring on her finger, I beg I plead...  
For the Love of Kattrine, bring her back to me...
