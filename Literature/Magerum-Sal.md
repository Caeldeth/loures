# Sal

_by Magerum in **Dark Ages**_

For the sun is mine and moon,  
And all things of love and light.  
For the morn is mine and noon,  
And all things of day and night.  
  
Harken to me, sons and daughters:  
Hear the wisdom in the waters.  
Listen to the river's laughter;  
Joy and peace shall flow thereafter.
