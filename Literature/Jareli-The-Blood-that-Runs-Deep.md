# The Blood that Runs Deep

_by Jareli in **Dark Ages**_

Someone was banging on the door. Startled out of her afternoon sleep, Jareli drew her blanket around her and hurried across the room. She opened the door and was met with a rain-soaked man wearing a long dark cloak and a hood around his face.

"Delivery for Jareli Moryann." He handed her a small box. "Have a good day, ma'am." He whisked himself onto his horse and was galloping away before she could thank him.

Closing her door against the rain, she eyed the package. She shook it a little. What could this be about?

She sat down in a chair and quickly tore away the wrapping. Then she lifted the lid. The first things she saw were a leather bound book and a rolled-up scroll. She undid the strings on the scroll and spread it.

Miss Jareli, We regret to inform you of the death of your sister, Octavia Moryann. She died honorably fighting beside our people against our enemies. We are awaiting your instructions for the burial. Endrel Luban, Octavia's Neighbor

Jareli closed her eyes tightly. So it had finally happened. After five years, she had lost someone dear to her again. She drew in a shaky breath and put the box on the table. She couldn't deal with this right now. She refused to deal with it. Instead, she busied herself in the kitchen, cleaning pots that were already spotless, washing a floor that never saw dirt, cooking enough dinner for an entire village, and all the while listening to the rain thundering down on her roof. But no matter what she tried, she could not distract her thoughts.

Two hours later, she sat down again and lifted the box. She removed the book and opened it. The name "Tavia Moryann" was printed in a calligraphic writing on the first page.

A journal. Tavia's journal. With shaky hands, she turned over the page and began reading.

***

I have never been one to keep a journal. In fact, I have never had the patience to sit for so long to write something. But my life has been long and hard, and so shall my story be.

Even now, after five years, I can remember every detail as if it is still happening. I can still feel the pain, the anxiety, the hopelessness. Especially the hopelessness. Not all wounds are healed with time. But by writing it all down, I am hoping that some of the burden will lift from my heart.

I do not know when it first began. Do all things have beginnings? They must, since the very start of every being's life is birth. But perhaps things are destined to happen even before we are out of our mother's womb. Why am I speaking of destiny? I do not know, since I hardly think it played any part in my life.

Right now, as I stare down at the blank pages, I try to remember not the beginning of it all, but the time things began to change.

My full name is Octavia Birik Moryann. I am the second of three daughters. Growing up as a farmer's daughter was...hard. No, not hard. It was tedious. It was dull and lifeless and I would wake up every morning with nothing to look forward to, and go to sleep every night dreading waking up in the morning. I spent days on end working in my father's fields, with the hot merciless sun burning overhead. Sometimes, I would take the cattle out to pasture. I hated it.

Some days, as I was working in the fields, I would see people walk by. I knew they strangers to my town by the way they were garbed. Some were young, others quite old, but every single one of them would be dressed in riches. I longed to be one of them.

I will try to tell my story as I remember it. Not to bore you to near death, I will leave out all unnecessary details, although I will tell enough to keep you busy for a while.

Here is my tale. Listen well, for you not only learn from your mistakes, but from the mistakes of others as well.

***

The midday sun was burning my eyes and my back hurt from crouching on the grape fields for so long. I straightened and stretched my arms, and happened to spot a group of people passing by.

I knew who they were. Strangers to my part of the country. Young, rich people who lived in the big cities and who led exciting lives. The kind of people that I envied from afar.

I watched them laugh and talk animatedly, and looked away when the same old loneliness gripped my chest. It was silly of me to yearn for something that would never happen. Instead, I wiped the sweat from my brow and started digging another hole with my shovel.

"Little girl!" A voice called out. Startled, I glance up to see that the group had stopped right in front of me.

Dumbfounded, I threw a look over my shoulder to make sure that they were talking to me. No one else was in sight.

"Can you tell us where the nearest blacksmith is?" One of them asked. I stared at her speechlessly. Never before had I seen any of them up close. She was dressed in a pure sparkling gold armor, and had a huge golden helmet covering her entire head, except for the face. The axe in her hand was of the same rich golden color as her clothing, and it looked to be about three times as big as the one that father used to chop firewood. From my crouching position, she seemed to tower over me.

It was when she spoke again that I realized that I hadn't answer her question. Pointing a finger, I stammered, "T-two houses down that road. T-take a left and you'll s-see it."

"Thanks, kid." She casually withdrew a leather pouch and flung it on the ground before me. Then they were gone.

I spent a good deal of time staring at the pouch. Never before had any of them spoken to me, much less presented me with a gift. With a look of awe, I finally undid the strings on the pouch and gasped. Gold. Lots and lots of it. The sight of it dazed my eyes far more than the burning sun above.

Questions burned in my head. Where did she get this much gold? Did she inherit it? Did she work for it? Was this the way people in the cities were living? Was this the way that I could be living?

I lay awake that night, listening to father's snores through the thin walls of the house. I remembered how mad my father had been when Akeiba, my older sister, had left home two years ago. He had accused her of deserting her family and had yelled after her that she was never to show her face in our village again.

I rolled over onto my back and stared at the dark ceiling. Would my father disown me too? Would he hate me? Just remembering the look of pure anger burning in his gray eyes that day made me cringe.

But as I drifted to sleep, a picture of me in all of that glorious gold played in my mind.

***

I confronted my father the next day. He was picking the ripe grapes from the fields when I said, "Father, I have something important to say. I have thought long and hard about this. I want to leave this town. I want to start a new life somewhere else."

He didn't answer.

"I really am serious."

"Stop these silly words and come help me." He said in a harsh voice.

I started to cower but somehow found the courage to say, "I don't belong here. I never did, and I never will. If you lo- if you want what's good for me, you will wish me the best and let me go."

He stood up so fast that I took an automatic step backward. He thrust his knife in my face and used it to emphasize every word he said by jabbing the air with it. "If you so much as set a foot out of this town, you are no longer a part of this family. I had told Akeiba that two years ago and I will give you the same warning. Do not return, do not send any letters, do not bother to try to remain a part of our life. I have kept this family together for so long and what do I get in return? Each one of my daughters leaves?"

"Jareli is still here," I said stiffly.

"For how long? Don't you think that she will decide to follow in your footsteps? She is merely a child and she looks up to you a great deal. What you do, she will do."

"No, she won't. She likes it here. I don't." I turned away abruptly and walked into the house. My mind was set. I was leaving, and nothing he said could influence me to do otherwise.

***

It took me but a few days to formulate my plan.

As I stuffed my few belongings into the old tattered bag, I thought of my father's reaction when he found the note beside my bed.

"Octavia, you are such a coward," I thought disdainfully, slinging the bag over my shoulder. Akeiba would never have snuck away like this. Then again, no could ever accuse her of being a coward. Maybe too spirited, but never yellow-bellied.

I looked around the room one last time to keep a lasting memory with me of what my life had been like, so that I could always compare it to my new life and feel relief. My eyes rested on Jareli. Sweet, little Jareli. I thought. I felt a wave of sadness at the prospect of never seeing her again. But she was young. She would forget me. I opened the door and crept into the night.

Walking through the dark town, I hummed a ditty to keep myself busy, although my body was buzzing with anticipation and anxiety. I patted my pockets about the tenth time to make sure that the gold that I had taken from the pouch was still there. The rest, my father would find on the dresser beside my bed. And hopefully, this much that I had on me would afford me a carriage into town and a place to sleep for a few nights.

Luck seemed to be on my side. For two gold coins, the man who owned the carriage would take me to a new town. Mileth, he called it. I hoped that it would be different from home.

I fell asleep on the way and was jolted back to consciousness when the carriage drew to a halt.

"There ya go, missy," He gave me a gap toothed grin after he helped me off the carriage. "This here town is Mileth."

"Sir, do you know if there's an inn around here?" I asked him before he turned away. "No, ma'am, I don't. Ha'ever , ya could ask the locals. G'day to ya." He slipped back into his carriage and left me behind to choke on his dust.

I swallowed, and looked around the unfamiliar terrain. Thank goodness that it was morning already. Who knew what kind of night creatures prowled this strange town?

After walking around for a while in dazed confusion, I managed, with the help of some friendly people, to locate the inn. Riona, the inn-keeper, was nice enough to charge me a reasonable price for my stay. The inn seemed okay enough, although I knew that it was rat infested by the scratching sounds in the walls, and some of the people living there were a bit off in the head.

I spent my first days walking around the town, learning my way around and observing the people. It was during this time that I discovered that golden woman was a warrior. I had no clue yet who or what she was fighting for, but I knew that I wanted to become just like her.

It wasn't long before I found a good mentor. He showed me the arts of the warrior, and led me to various shops where I could buy good clothes and useful weapons. When I asked him exactly what I would use the weapons against, he laughed and told me that I would learn in time.

But he disappeared shortly after that. If something had happened to him, I will never know, for I have never seen or heard from him ever since.

Life began to go uphill from there. As the days went by, my gold coins became less and less abundant, until one day I found myself completely without a penny to my name. I tried begging, for I had seen others do it, and soon realized that being turned away was far too disappointing, and so, I stopped asking for gold altogether.

Instead, I started running errands for the local shop-keepers around town, earning enough pocket change for food and shelter. I spent two years in this state, until I awoke one morning to discover, with quite some dismay, that I was in a worse state than I had been on my father's farm.

But what could an unskilled, inexperienced person like me do to make a living? I discovered one day exactly what I was good at.

***

Two years in Mileth was long enough to have hardened my heart. Instead of being near tears when someone would verbally assault me on the streets, I would fling insults back. I learned how to spear a rat with a knife from a far distance. I learned how to be sneaky enough in delaying paying for my room and board. And gradually, I descended the dark path, until one day, I found myself stealing.

I became acquainted with some thieves, who taught me how to pick locked doors and steal people's pouches from their belts. I would quietly break into their houses and take their valuables. I learned how to deftly reach into someone's pocket and withdraw their riches without them being the wiser. Soon enough, I could afford buying the most expensive clothing and jewelry, and I finally had more than enough gold to move out of the dump that I was living in.

In order to accomplish all of this, I taught myself that no one ever gets anything with honesty and fairness. Those kinds of beliefs were for fools, as they had never gained me anything before. I taught myself to ignore the twinge of guilt I felt whenever I heard someone wailing about their lost gold, or someone walking around shoeless after I had sold theirs for a good price. And so I lived on, always taking and never giving, only caring about me, myself and I...until I met my sister one day.

***

Living in Mileth gave me an opportunity to travel. I would hire a great carriage and travel through towns on end, experiencing different varieties of people and food, and I found the latter to be a great pleasure.

On around the third year since I left home, I ran into Akeiba with a group of her friends at a tavern in Abel. Imagine my shock to discover that all of this time, she had been living right under my nose.

Filled with joy at seeing someone so dear to my heart, I ran up to her. "Aki, I can't believe it's you! It's been so long."

My smile turned into a look of uncertainty when she stared at me with a blank face. "Don't you recognize me?"

One of the young men next to her assessed me with a hard look. "Akeiba, who is this girl?"

Feeling puzzled, I tried once again, "It's me, Tavia. Don't you recognize me?"

I felt relief when she smiled. She turned to the man and said. "Yes, she's one of my father's children."

I was what? I blinked in surprise and stared. "Aki-"

"Oh, wow, I'm really tired. Adrius, darling, I'm going to wait for you in the carriage." Then she looked at me. "It was nice seeing you again...Tavia."

I watched her in shock as she walked out of the tavern and climbed into her carriage, before I realized bitterly that this was to be my punishment for disobeying my father's words. I was without family once again.

***

The incident played in my mind a lot over the course of the next year. Having moved from Mileth, I found myself in Rucesion, the same town that Akeiba was apparently living in. I saw her and her husband on the streets on more than one occasion, and I was careful to avoid looking at her, although it hurt when she acted as if I did not exist. Perhaps to her, I didn't.

I had mentioned that I traveled a lot. But the only place that I never set foot in again was my old town. I knew that once I did, it would bring back painful memories and I couldn't afford to be heart broken forever. Instead, I relied on my ears and listened in on stranger's conversations when they happened to be discussing my hometown.

Which is how I learned of the shocking news one night as I strolled through the town.

"Poor folks," A man with a pipe in his mouth puffed out, shaking his head sadly. "The plague has already finished off half of them. And the rest have no hope of makin' it out alive."

The blood froze in my veins. Half? What half? Was my father okay? Jareli? When was the nearest carriage that was going to my hometown? Could I make it there in time?

My mind was swimming with questions. For the first time since I gained myself confidence, I felt helpless. I had no idea what to do. I needed help, but who could I turn to? There was no one I knew that I could trust. I had only acquaintances, not friends who would be there for me.

Akeiba. Yes, blood was thick. But was ours thick enough?

Not caring that it was in the middle of the night, I rushed to her house and knocked on the door. Please, God, let her awake, I silently prayed.

The door opened and I gasped in shock. "Akeiba, what happened to your face?!"

"Shhh," She pressed an index finger against her lips. "You might awaken him." She stepped outside of the house and closed the door quietly behind her.

"He did this to you? He's a monster! Why are you still in the house with him? Why didn't you tell anyone?" I shouted hysterically as I followed her down the steps and through the streets.

"Be quiet. Do not speak of things that you do not know of," She whispered harshly. I shut my mouth and followed her to a bench. We sat in silence for a while, my own mind brewing with the two disasters that I had learned of in that one night. When Akeiba lifted a hand to lightly touch the purple bruise below her eye, I felt my gut clench in anger. She might have ignored me for the past year, but Akeiba was my sister. And that brute had no right to hurt her like this.

I finally began slowly, "For two years, right before I left home, I had spent a lot of my time thinking of you. Of where you were living, who you were with, what you were doing. I have always pictured you surrounded by friends and living a life of luxury and happiness. That much seemed true when I met you last year at the inn. But never would I have imagined that my independent, strong-willed older sister would be stupid enough to be living with a man who would physically abuse her!"

Akeiba spoke abruptly, "He does not abuse me. I-it was my fault this time."

"This time? I'm guessing that means there were other times. By God, I knew that he was not a good man ever since I laid my eyes on him in-"

"You don't get it, do you?" Akeiba interrupted. She jumped to her feet and flung her arms in the air. "I am nothing without him. He saved me, Tavia. He gave me a home, food, security. He showers me with jewels and riches if I but ask of him. He deserves my loyalty, little sister. He has saved me from a life of misery."

"Did he really?" I said bitterly. I decided to drop that subject. There was something far more serious that we needed to discuss. "Akeiba, a lot of people back home have contracted the plague. I do not know if father and Jareli have fallen ill too."

Akeiba's eyes widened. I continued, "We must return home. Our family needs us."

She shook her head, "I cannot. Adrius would not allow it. He made it clear when I married him that he would be my only family."

"They might be dead," I said bluntly, "And all you can think of is how upset your husband might get?"

"Besides, father made it clear that he wanted me to never return home. Please don't ask this of me," She turned pleading eyes on me. "I'm sorry."

I stood up, feeling more disappointed in her than I ever had been in anyone else. "Yes, I'm sure that you are sorry." I turned my back to her. "I wish you a good life, Akeiba. I hope that you don't meet a lot of disappointments in life. Goodbye, sister."

I heard her say, "Tell me everything when you return." I didn't look back at her or slow down, but something in my heart died that night. It was hope.

***

My journey back home took less than a few hours. I prayed the whole time, and my stomach felt like it was in coils, my hands were cold and clammy. The weather outside agreed with my mood. I could see dark clouds gathering overhead, clearing indicating that a very bad storm was about to occur.

My ride finally drew to a halt in front of father's house. I got down from the carriage and paid and thanked the driver. Then I turned to my old home and started to walk.

I was surprised, and then overcome with relief to see Jareli standing in front of the house.

"Jari!" I yelled in joy. Tears gathered in my eyes and I blinked to hold them back. Oh, my little sister. How glad I was to see that nothing had happened to her.

She watched me, but didn't come forward. Instead, I started walking toward her.

"No! Don't come any closer!" She yelled, holding out her hand to stop me.

Oh, God, not her too. Was I to be shunned yet again by another sister? "Please, Jari-"

"You can't come near me." She said, a little softer this time. "You might get sick."

I didn't know whether to feel glad that she was not angry with me, or devastated that she might be sick with the plague. "Where is father?"

"He's dead," She answered in a blunt, matter-of-fact voice. Then she shrugged, "You missed him by a day."

"Oh, Jari. I'm so sorry," I said. "I should have been here sooner." I fought hard to keep the tears at bay. I needed to be strong for her. "Did-did you bury him?"

"No." Suddenly, her chin trembled. "I couldn't move his body."

I didn't care about contracting the plague from her. I rushed over and enveloped her thin, frail body in my arms. She let out a sob and her shoulders shook with the force of her tears. As if on cue, the rain started falling gently, and the smell of wet earth rose to fill my nostrils. I held her like this for countless moments.

Together, we carried my father's body outside the house. We laid him down on the ground, and my eyes memorized his face. He had changed so much. His once brown hair was streaked with gray, his normally ruddy complexion was pale, his skin loose and dry. Even his body, that had once been strong, and healthy, was weak and fragile from his ill-fated struggle against the plague. I picked up a shovel, and was hit by the irony of it. Here I was, four years later, holding the same shovel that I vowed never to touch again. I let out a hysterical laugh at the absurdity of it all.

The task of burying him was long, tiring, and sloppy, due to the wetness of the earth and our bodies. But I knew that what we felt in doing it was a sense of completion. My father would have wanted for us to be doing this together. He would have wanted me to be taking care of him in death, just as I had when he had health. And most of all, he would want for me to be home.

"It's done." I finally said, sticking the shovel into the soft earth. I pushed my wet hair out of my face and gave Jareli a sad smile. "We're done."

She nodded and extended a hand out to me. Feeling a huge lump in my throat, I grasped her soft, cold hand in mine, and we stood together, sister and sister, watching the falling rain soak into the ground that held my father.

***

It's so hard for me to relieve it all over again. I fear that I will go blind if I cry one more time. I think that I have cried enough tears to last anyone a lifetime.

All that I can say to end this sad tale is that my little sister and I agreed that we led two entirely different lives. And so, after a week together, she was welcomed into her neighbors' family, and I went back to my old, but not first, life. I never spoke with Akeiba again, but I felt proud of her when I heard that she had left her husband and was making a life for herself.

I have spent the past five years in Rucesion. I was wrong in what I had said at the beginning. Honesty and fairness might not always have immediate outcomes, but in the long run, it is what shapes all of our lives; the way we live, the way people feel about us, and the way we die. And I thank God that I have finally realized how much I would prefer to die with a good heart.

Octavia Moryann. Second daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs. Belforst Moryann.

***

Jareli's tears were flowing freely down her cheeks by the time she was finished. She drew the book to her chest and hugged it tightly, imagining that it was Tavia that she was hugging. She could not believe it. Despite it all, Tavia had suffered as much as Jareli and their father had.

She started to put the book back in the box when a little note fell from the pages. She unfolded it and read.

To Jareli, Hello my beloved little sister. If you are reading this, it means that I'm gone. Do not mourn me, darling. There are many things that I regret, but I am happy now, and that is what matters the most.

There are a few things that I would like you to have. First is my journal. It contains everything that has happened in my life, some of which you know of, and some of it my own secret thoughts. I hope that by reading it, you feel a little less resentment for me. Yes, I know I'm selfish, even in death. But I cannot bear the thought that you will hate me for all of eternity.

Also in the box is a simple gold ring. It was our mother's wedding ring. Father gave it to me a while before I left home. I believe with all of my heart that he would want you to have it.

There is one more item in the box. A bracelet. Do you remember, sister? I think that I will never forget the day you, me, and Akeiba bought three identical bracelets with the gold father gave us the day he had sold a lot of the cattle. Hard to believe that three gold coins each was the most we had ever gotten in our youth. This bracelet, it symbolizes our bond, which will always be as strong and solid as the metal on the bracelet. Keep it close to your heart forever more.

I end this letter with my love. I love you, Jareli, more than you could ever imagine. I want the best for you in life. Be happy, my little sweet, for happiness is far more valuable than all of the riches in the world. Take care of yourself, and tell Akeiba that I love her as well, and that I forgive her for everything.

With love and best wishes, From Octavia

In a period of five years, Jareli was digging a second grave in the same field, with her sister again. She glanced at Akeiba and their eyes met. Jareli felt shy. She had been young when her oldest sister had left home. She did not know her as well as she did Tavia. Tears clogged up her throat. No, not as she did. As she had.

They dug the hole and gently lowered her into it. Jareli placed the journal next to Tavia's body, and they filled the hole with dirt. They sat on a large rock to rest when they were done.

"So what now?" Akeiba asked.

Jareli drew her knees up and circled her arms around her legs. "I guess it's over."

"No, it's not over," Akeiba said firmly. "It is the beginning. For us."

Jareli watched the trees sway in rhythm with one another, felt the gentle breeze against her skin, heard the newborn baby chicks chirp for food with which to start their new lives. Spring. A time of rebirth and a new start for all.

She looked over at her sister. Akeiba smiled. She smiled back.

Yes, it was the beginning.
