# The Mines of Kasman

_Mauve in **Dark Ages**_

I stand before a mountain  
A mouth of blackness deep  
My voice echoes, distorted  
Joined buy others from within

Compelled to step inside  
I tremble with fear  
To see what bodies belong  
To the voices I hear

My feet will not move  
My heart skips a beat  
Two eyes are gazing  
Back out at me

What does it belong to?  
An Aisling like me?  
Perhaps it's a dwarf  
From the songs people sing

My weapon is sharp  
My armor is new  
My courage has risen  
Another step or two

I pause, I hesitate  
My hands begins to sweat  
Its just another step  
But as I cross the threshold  
I see visions of my death.

I make an oath  
To the watching eyes  
I will return one day  
And walk within this mine.
