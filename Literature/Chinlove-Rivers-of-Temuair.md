# Rivers of Temuair

_By Chinlove of **Dark Ages**_

I have visited the rivers of Temuair
Clear pristine water flowing free
Varieties of fishes unknown to me
Big and small they swim and dance
In the afternoon under Red Temuair Sun

I have visited the rivers of Temuair
Mileth River wide and long
Rounding through the village clear and strong
Water from the mountain afar
Invisible to us yet the presence is strong

I have visited the rivers of Temuair
Piet River silent and unknown
Slow flowing water glistening in the day
Reflections of me I always gaze
And a pair of imaginary eyes I stare
With love and passion I remain

I have visited the rivers of Temuair
Suomi River flowing through Undine
Longest river in Temuair
Water gushing past with speed and force
Feels me with never ending energy force

I have visited the rivers of Temuair
Kasmanium Mine River Beautiful and Magical
The life giving force of Dracos
Beautiful and serene in the day
Dark and dangerous in the night
Yet its my most beloved river
Tis here I come with my love
Without any care in the world

The rivers of Temuair With different styles and character
Oh how many more are hidden
In my beloved magical Land
