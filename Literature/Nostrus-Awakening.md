# Awakening

_by Nostrus in **Dark Ages**_

All I see is blood and dying  
Children's tears `mongst flashing blades  
All I hear is mothers crying  
Horrid shrieks of undead shades  

As the stench of rotting corpses  
Mercilessly fills my nose  
My ears are full of evil voices  
That no one understands but those  

Who saw the burning depths of Hatred  
Immersed their souls in pools of blood  
Stood Death's glance both clad and naked  
And heard the call of our true God  

As You always stood beside me  
I know I'll survive this night  
Ceannlaidir, oh God almighty  
Lead my sword and be my guide
