# Message to Macabre

Glioca's hand reaches beyond the plague,  
Her love does not end at the grave.  
She calls to me, and I to you,  
Abandon hate and the blood you crave!  

Glioca's love will resurrect your soul.  
Though body decay, the heart remains.  
I come to help her make you whole,  
With love I come to heal your pain.  

So long have you suffered in the shadow.  
Return to the grave! Your body is but a cage.  
Join your soul to mine, for a time.  
I will lead you beyond the rage.  

_By Miria_  
_young priestess of Glioca_  
_missionary to Macabre_
