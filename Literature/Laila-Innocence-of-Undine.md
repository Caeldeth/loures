# Innocence of Undine

_by Laila in **Dark Ages**_

Children of Undine gather near  
Thy captures and pursuers must not find thee here  
The rain shall muffle our flight trough the mud  
The downpour will dilute our enemy‘s lust for blood  
Make haste with me little one to a better place  
Such innocence I thought should not be lied to, to face  
Bewildered and hungry innocence followed blindly  
Where I will be taking thee my god shall praise me highly  
Silently and swiftly we made our progression  
Not to Undine, but the outskirts of Rucesion  
"Where are we going?" innocence replied  
"To an old castle, a place where we can hide"  
Drawing nigh to the castle we entered with subterfuge  
Although arriving with two I shall leave in solitude  
I entered the inner sanctum of the temple with prayer  
In the room I felt his presence I knew he was there  
I turned to innocence with dialogue in mind  
Innocence returned to me attention in kind  
"Power and Strength, they come at a price"  
"My dignity and humanity, I am willing to sacrifice"  
Not understanding the ways of men  
Innocence's life had come to an end  
Dialogue said, and deed done  
Sgrios pleased, and spell spun  
Reward received and power gained  
I trek back to Astrid to begin again  

_Lailia, Priestess of Sgrios_
