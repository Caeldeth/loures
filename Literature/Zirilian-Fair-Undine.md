# Fair Undine

_by Zirilian in **Dark Ages**_

'Twixt land and sea lies Fair Undine,  
Sweet innocent homeland of mine.  
Oppressed by Loures so dark and hard  
A thousand tears in one small shard  
Of glass, which lies upon the ground  
A hundred children gone and found.  
It is their cries, upon mine ear  
And I cannot to chuse but hear  
The wails of a million tourtured souls  
Fall to the goblins, orcs and trolls.  

'Twixt land an sea lies Fair Undine  
Sweet innocent homeland of mine.  
For others I've not eye nor ear  
Though you I cannot chuse but hear,  
I've not a soul for ought but thou  
In the past and here and now.  
Loures weeps crocodile tears  
For Undine whom I hold so dear.  

'Twixt land and sea lies Fair Undine  
Sweet innocent homeland of mine.  
I sing your praises and your sorrows  
And when sunrise brings the morrow,  
Still I shall be mourning thee,  
O Undine who's so dear to me.  
I would but tell my mournful tale,  
Though all the aislings I should hail  
Turn their heads and noses up  
And never shall I tell.  

'Twixt land and sea lies Fair Undine  
Sweet innocent homeland of mine.  
Once there was a battle and  
You lost to Bruces' iron hand.  
Now we have a second chance,  
And taking up my fighting stance  
I set prepared to fight the beasts  
Of oppression and of hate  
And the shame it brings upon  
Shall we be free, come the dawn?  

'Twixt land and sea lies Fair Undine  
Sweet innocent homeland of mine.  
Heed me aislings, listen well!  
This will end right here and now!  
Loures will fall and Undine's pride,  
Shall be known both far and wide!  
Today we shall make history!  
LIft your sword and fight with me!  
Bring our wrath  
On unsuspecting Loures,  
Let Undine's freedom ring!
