# An Herbalist's Misfortune

_by Raeven of **Dark Ages**_

I cannot make you potions,  
no matter what you pay.  
Nay, I won't go near that glade  
no matter what you say.  
Picking flowers gives me hives,  
I choke and gasp and sneeze.  
Just one glance at betony  
and I begin to wheeze.  
See this scratchy, awful rash  
that covers me complete?  
I contracted it from herbs,  
so I admit defeat.  
You say there's a cure for me?  
Then tell me, don't delay!  
... I need to find hydele?  
You scoundrel! Go away!
