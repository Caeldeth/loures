# My Light

_by Malicus in **Dark Ages**_

Yea thou I walk through the halls of the dubhaimid I shalt fear no darkness  
For thou art the light and the way  

Thy Symbol and Thy Staff doth comfort Me  
Thou leadest me beside the clear waters so I may drink in Mileth's sweetness  
Thou doth showest me thy love and the beauty of Cail's gardens  
For thou art the light and the way

Thou makest me a feast in the presense of mine enemies so we may share in your  
compassion and peace  
Thou healest the scars of Sgrios so that we may forget the horrors of death  
and be returned to the life that Deoch has given unto us  
For thou art the light and the way

The cup of thy love doth surely runnth to over flowing and Thy mercy doth  
encompass the whole of Temuair  
Thou art the candle in the window for Mundane and Aisling in the coldness of  
winter and thy heat doth bring out the lovers fires in spring  
For thou art the light and the way  

In the darkness of night thy light shines bright  
for thou art the light and the way  

_Malicus of Mileth_  
_Priest of Glioca_  
_Deoch 20_
