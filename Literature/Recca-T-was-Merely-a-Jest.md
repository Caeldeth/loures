# T'was Merely a Jest

_by Recca in **Dark Ages**_

Please sir goblin I am a humble squire  
I did not mean to burn with fire  
I will replace thy garments  
and mend thy dents  
t’was merely a jest, a simple and harmless jest  

I did not mean to poke your eyes  
I was just swating at flies  
they are plentiful around this season  
all in all tis a very good reason  
t’was only a jest, a careless yet harmless jest  

Oderous ha! Don’t make me laugh  
I was not speaking on thy behalf  
sturdy and solid is the persona thou portray  
there is no way a mere asling can stand in thy way  
t’was merely a jest, a friviless yet tolerable jest  

I beg thee sirs souround me not  
the day has been too long and hot  
I’ve tried so hard to keep my composure  
but if thou cometh any closer I’ll have to leave thy closure  
t’was only a jest, a simple yet fruitless jest  

Waraxe and club in hand, oh dear  
i’m in a bit of trouble I fear  
straight for the forest I start to bolt  
with a twist of my wrist I startle to a halt  
t’was merely a jest, a simple yet har%&$!?!? THUD!?!?!...  

I smell the scent of dead wood and moss  
accompanied by the Underlord Sgrios  
I fail at my attempt to make new friends  
to skin their hides and make my ends  
next time I’ll conserve and know what to do  
goblins won’t make me into Asling stew  
they will relize the nature of my quest  
a painful, unforgiving, yet well deserved jest
