# The Song of Gods  

_by Miray in **Dark Ages**_

In her eyes dwells a loving gaze,  
That fills us with her might.  
_The Lady Danaan_ we shall praise,  
Her sacrifice for light.  

His fight is not to slay his foe,  
But to defend the art of peace.  
_Lord Cail_ knows not the art of war,  
Though battle is his geas.  

A battle joined as sword strikes shield,  
And warriors sing of glory.  
_Lord Ceannlaidir_ shall never yield,  
For all are shown his fury.  

As battles raged and fires burned,  
And darkness took our light.  
_Lord Deoch_ in his passion turned,  
And joined us in our fight.  

With speed akin to dagger's gleam,  
And pockets lined in treasure,  
_Fioshad the Swift_ his eyes are keen,  
His cunning is his pleasure.  

Compassion is her gift to man,  
And hate is not her wish,  
_Lady Glioca_ guides the hand,  
Of those who know her kiss.  

His ears are sharp, his voice is low,  
His eyes see every flaw.  
_Lord Gramail_ his ways are slow,  
But his honor is our law.  

With opened eyes, his gnosis shines,  
So does his wisdom flow.  
_Luathas the Wise_ shall guide our minds,  
And let our knowledge grow.  

His silent terror fills the dark,  
The death of light his goal.  
_Sgrios the Damned_ shall grasp the heart,  
As his scars tear out the soul.  

A blackened void of evil calls,  
He laughs as others weep.  
_Lord Chadul_ waits as darkness falls,  
And smiles within his sleep.
