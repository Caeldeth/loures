# Dreamer  

_by Logoth in **Dark Ages**_

The dreamer sits on a bench  
an old war wound pains him  
he watches younger aislings  
walking by on their way  
perhaps to battle  
perhaps to learn a new spell

He remembers the way it was  
when he was young  
eagerly searching for battle  
gaining insight  
growing in wisdom  
learning new spells

Now he helps other aislings  
sharing his wisdom  
deochs old

He is a guard  
protecting other aislings  
helping solve their problems

A high priest of his faith  
he assists with prayer  
asks his god to bless items  
and casts a regular mass

It may seem that he has little  
to wake up for in the morning  
but he always finds an excuse

As he watches  
a woman appears  
dressed in red  
she smiles at him  
and sits down beside him
