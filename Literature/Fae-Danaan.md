# Danaan

_by Fae in **Dark Ages**_

Danaan, My goddess, where did you go?  
You gave us our life, but took your own.

Did you go to the heavens, where they say you belong?  
Or are you down on this world, listening to every song?  
I wish you could come, I wish you could see  
The moon in the sky, reflecting on the sea.  

Danaan My goddess, where did you go?  
You know so much of us, but of you, we do not know.  

Will you return, from where ever you are?  
Without you here, is like the night without stars.  

I miss your bright face  
I miss your warm hands  
I miss the heat of your body  
I miss the way you light up the lands  

Danaan My goddess, I know where you are!  
You are not the moon, nor a star  
but you are the sun, that lightens the day  
You are there, and there you'll always stay.
