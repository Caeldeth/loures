# The Frog at the Swamp

_by Elmo in **Dark Ages**_

There is no place as slimy and dirty  
As you maybe know the water is murky  
But maybe for you  
The skies will stay blue  
And your hopes will rise for surely  

Once I was there  
And without a single care  
I sat beside a frog  
And started drinking my grog  
The frog looked at me  
His eyes lit up with glee  
So I stoped to think  
And I said to the froggy,  
"sorry but I don't think frogs drink"  

His eyes looked very sad  
But quickly turned mad  
He snapped his jaws wildly  
And grinded his teeth childly  
As he tore off my favourite red rag  

He gave me a nudge  
I was ready to plunge  
But attack as he might  
I was ready to fight  
Though I wish not for the poor frog to die  

So I said to the frog  
I'll give you some Grog  
But this stuff could end your life  

He took it off me  
And was happy with glee  
As I said to myself  
"that frog is not shy"  

So what have we learnt about frogs when they're sober  
Is it that there much nicer when there drunk and passed over  
Or maybe that we shouldn't mess with mother nature  
For when the animals are sober they can be a danger  

So all you mundanes and aislings too  
We'll raise our glasses and put down our food  
Then lets raise a toast to mother nature  
Hoping she will drink too and be no more danger
