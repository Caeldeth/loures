# Heart of Moon

_by Imajica in **Dark Ages**_

Darkness clings to my soul  
The moon that is my heart shines forth  
Into the darkness, the neverending night  
As I am the moon, he is the flame  
The fire that consumes my soul reflects in his eyes  
Sparking creativity, emotions, and light  
I'd never sought out companionship, or love  
Yet he began to illuminate the darkest of nights  
Once love chased the shadows from my life  
I bathed in his light as often as possible  
Eventually the night relinquished its grip on me  
My heart began to yearn for the night  
To become the moon once more  
To illuminate the darkness, and call forth shadows  
Perhaps love is a true folly,  
Only the gods know for sure  
As we completed the ancient ceremonies  
Binding my darkness to his light  
I found what peace truly was  
Allowing the light to cast dark shadows  
Learning to embrace the night which is the core of my soul.  

# Heart of Fire

My soul is infused with light  
It reflects upon her heart, the moon  
Out of the darkness, dispelling the shadows  
As I am the flame, she is the moon  
The moon that illuminates the darkest of nights  
Sparking imagination, dreams, and love  
Her darkness I had sought to dispel  
Once love had Found us, promising an eternal bond  
I chased all the darkness from her dreams  
But then, as light pervaded every corner of her being  
I realised there is no moon without the night  
The light holds hands with the shadows in perfect harmony  
I have learned from her the flame, like the moon  
Needs the darkness to be complete  
Perhaps even love requires such a balance  
Only the gods know for sure  
As we completed the ancient ceremonies  
Binding my light to her darkness  
I learned what peace was  
Allowing the shadows to dance and play  
Embracing the light which is the core of my soul.
