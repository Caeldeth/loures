# The Secret of the Garden

_by Aselus in **Dark Ages**_

_To the little creatures that saved my life so many times_  

Many people wander off to many different sites  
And many people wander through the swirling beds of lights  

They wander seeing many things but none so mesmerizing  
That oh this secret almost makes their lives so tantalizing  

The thing that tickles noses stoutly  
and hides from view almost abruptly  

It makes the potion that saves lives  
And none of it ever.. ever lies  

It glitters, shimmers and moves fast  
As if its light would last and last

This secret is a little creature  
That makes almost the quietest feature  

Upon this garden flowing vast  
The faeries just erase the past.
