# Scripts de la luna

_by Atticus in **Dark Ages**_

Upon the burning ridges of the mountain-top remains,  
seated on the coal left, and still scared as ancient manes..  

On each of these fires, that burn from afar, and that  
the soul of envy will better left be gone.

Unto the wicked fragments, of druids cthonic remains,  
through the souless mortals, whose hands with blood are stained.  

Cursed, and the wretched, beasts of mighty  
awe, and to the lightly priests, whose spells are heard  
by all. May these words be shattered, to the walls of  
godly time, and grant me this true power, both holy  
and divine.  

_" kama se du sentris, ali mak rumain es tu de  
lo gotha tres nudaich en suain, bres ke la de gar  
untolis de blek un, inti madis gala.... ae goth gar" (unholy storm)_  

As I sit upon this altar and chant these sacred scripts,  
demons rise up forth, and scratch at the abyss.   

Feeding off of blood, and dancing in thier corpse,  
I summon unholy power to free there souls with force.

The demons crumble down, the spirits, flee on ease,  
the heavens are now shining, the hell is but deceased.  
Upon the ancient landmark, of cthonic where i stood, I  
step down to fertile lands, once covered in recourse.  
The aislings now rejoice, the suffering is gone, swept  
by the mighty force, of unholy seismic storms.

Step freely on the land, the demons are no longer here.  
I cursed away the evils to shine a better light, for  
all that is faroff, and everything in sight.

May peace be with you all, follow your true path, and  
let your leaders guide you on the lightest of all paths.
