# Nature's Renowned

_by Artigan in **Dark Ages**_

In Undines fields, where Nature blooms  
And singing birds glide 'cross the sky  
We gather 'round, remove our shoes  
And praise our lord, on which all rely  

He stands for balance, he stands for peace  
Asks not a morsel in return  
He watches over nature, without cease  
And protects all living, from fungus to fern  

He stands for patience, that strange virtue  
Which many lose and so few gain  
He stands for harmony, through and through  
And balances our bliss with pain  

He stands for silence, the golden rule  
Which O', so many an Aisling break  
He stands for benevolence, for nothing cruel  
In hopes we do not make mistake  

We praise this man, this being, this god  
In hopes of being more like Him  
We do not lie, nor make façade  
We fill our cups with His wisdom, to the brim  

We follow His work, we look through His eyes  
We try our best, strive not to fail  
We seek His guidance, for He is wise  
For the one we follow, His name is Cail  

Born between the union of  
Glioca and strong Ceannlaidir  
His life's been hard, with little love  
Which may be why He's so sincere  

Yet in spite of his troubled past  
He accepts others, without doubt  
His attitude is unsurpassed  
And at no-one does fair Cail flout  

Some believe Him to be a Monk  
A gentle fighter, thankful for all things  
Some believe Him to be a drunk  
Not knowing the wondrous gifts he brings  

Some believe Him to be distressing  
A boulder obstructing their everyday life  
But others, like us, only take in His blessing  
And choose not to consider fair Cail as strife  

His name is said, and it stands strong  
In all our hearts, it radiates light  
For we are his followers, and in our throng  
We know that all He says is right  

So as we stand upon this ground  
In Undine's land, where lays His shrine  
We praise fair Cail, Nature's renowned  
And in our lives, let His light shine
