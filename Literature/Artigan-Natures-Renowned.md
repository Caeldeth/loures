~ _Nature�s Renowned_ ~



In Undine�s fields, where Nature blooms

And singing birds glide �cross the sky

We gather �round, remove our shoes

And praise our lord, on which all rely



He stands for balance, he stands for peace

Asks not a morsel in return

He watches over nature, without cease

And protects all living, from fungus to fern



He stands for patience, that strange virtue

Which many lose and so few gain

He stands for harmony, through and through

And balances our bliss with pain



He stands for silence, the golden rule

Which O�, so many an Aisling break

He stands for benevolence, for nothing cruel

In hopes we do not make mistake



We praise this man, this being, this god

In hopes of being more like Him

We do not lie, nor make façade

We fill our cups with His wisdom, to the brim



We follow His work, we look through His eyes

We try our best, strive not to fail

We seek His guidance, for He is wise

For the one we follow, His name is Cail



Born between the union of

Glioca and strong Ceannlaidir

His life�s been hard, with little love

Which may be why He�s so sincere



Yet in spite of his troubled past

He accepts others, without doubt

His attitude is unsurpassed

And at no-one does fair Cail flout



Some believe Him to be a Monk

A gentle fighter, thankful for all things

Some believe Him to be a drunk

Not knowing the wondrous gifts he brings



Some believe Him to be distressing

A boulder obstructing their everyday life

But others, like us, only take in His blessing

And choose not to consider fair Cail as strife



His name is said, and it stands strong

In all our hearts, it radiates light

For we are his followers, and in our throng

We know that all He says is right



So as we stand upon this ground

In Undine�s land, where lays His shrine

We praise fair Cail, Nature�s renowned

And in our lives, let His light shine
