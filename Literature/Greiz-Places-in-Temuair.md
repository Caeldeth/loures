# Places in Temuair

_by Greiz in **Dark Ages**_

I lie awake in Mileth Inn  
On my bed so soft and clean  
Thinking of the places that I have seen  
In where all day I have been  

Firstly, I went to the East Woodlands  
There I saw variety of trees  
With huge stems and bulky strands  
And roaming butterflies and buzzing bees  

Next I went to Mehadi Swamp  
The soil was soft and damp  
With many flowers you should see  
From Tulsi, Nila and Sevti  

And then I went where I should not be  
Because this place is really creepy  
On my first, step a zombie greeted me  
And so I really had to flee.  

Next stop I landed on the Port of Abel  
Where merchants buy and sell  
The ships in there were big and well  
How many were there? I could not tell  

Then I entered Loures Battle Ring  
Where warriors slash furiously  
While monks punch continuously  
And wizards cast spells simultaneously  

These are the places you should really see  
Seeing them will make you amazed and happy  
Because Temuair is a real place to be  
It is a place filled with fun and glee
