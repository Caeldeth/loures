# The Mummy

_by Gilly of **Dark Ages**_  

Three Aislings high, the mummy towers overhead  
An embalmed orc? I wince and wonder with great dread  
Why could he be after a wimpy wizardling like me?  
For I pose no possible threat to such a one as great as he.  

Running towards our rogue, I trip and fall upon my face  
If only with my last insight, I had instead increased my grace  
Swiping at my fallen form, with great claw-tipped hands  
I flash back to the beauty of Abel beach's sands.  

The rest of my group faces the same dire straits as I  
Our priestess lies just over there, her body's blood not dry  
Staring into that mummy's wrapped stone cold gray face  
I cringe inside to know I will be soon in Sgrios' embrace.
