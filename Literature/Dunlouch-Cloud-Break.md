# Cloud Break

_by Dunlouch of **Dark Ages**_

The glimmering sun breaks the  
sleepy silence dancing with the darkness.  
Pure and rich as the Hy-Brasyl night  
sweeping into a sinewy light.  
Billowing clouds entangle tenderly  
bursting forth uniting her desire, blazing  
sherbet caresses down lavender tresses.  

Dazzled with passion intense and full,  
unmundane beat the heart of an aisling.  
Nursing her dreams, twirling near streams.  

The clouds break announcing the day  
shining warm love on the polished rogue,  
rolling across Deochs they reluctantly  
unfold her fate.  
The silky hair along her neck stood  
intuitively taut, revealing itself a deceptive plot.  

Ill stars falls as the shrill of fear laced itself into the innocent floating forms.  
Chaotic blackness broken by daggers of white shattered the cloak.  
As it was in the Drowning of Hy-Brasyl,  
so today was the shredding of her heart.  

Maddening fear clutched her soul, dizzy with betrayal  
skin milky and pale,  
fleeing from her fear  
to Rucesion her only friend.  

Past the cobbled walls and sturdy halls she  
stopped to take a breath, and  
as she passed  
a glimpse in the glass reflected her only real fear.  
An aisling heart claimed by Chadul, ripper of dreams.
