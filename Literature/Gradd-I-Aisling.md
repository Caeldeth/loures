# I, Aisling

> Light of my life,  
> Forever._

Never before has someone surpassed all of my expectations but she. And as you
have commanded me, my beloved, I have recounted that night here on paper. I
shall send it to the Mundanes in hopes that they learn from my experience, and
know that they shall forever have their Guardian in me.

_"Dear Danaan, please help us sinful children of Temuair..."_

Thunder crackled off in the distance, and lightning flashed brilliantly against
the gray skies above Astrid. Before the Pentagram Grimoire I stood. I reached
the Astrid fields in the late evening. I was dressed in my black leathers, with
an ebony cape wrapped tightly around me to protect from the cold.

had little or no trouble dealing with the weak Kobolds of these fields. My only
goal was to reach the Pentagram. And I had. Before this pentagram I had slain
my wicked father. Before this pentagram I had held the lifeless body of my dear
mother. And before this pentagram I was reborn. Reborn with a higher purpose in
life; to be an Aisling.

It was here that I held beheld a vision of Danaan by the blessing of Deoch. He
had shown me my grand purpose in life. I saw the selfless sacrifice that she
gave to every and single person, so that they might know life to it's truest
form.

With my head bowed, I had whispered my prayer; a prayer to both Danaan and
Deoch, lovers entwined for eternity, even through life and death. I prayed for
a sign, for some kind of answer to my troubles. Was my mission a fraud? Was I
just a nobody in the grand scheme of things? I prayed with all of my heart,
mind, and soul for that answer. I wanted so much to serve them. I remembered
life without them, life without purpose. They had given it to me. But now, I
felt as if I was ignored, as if they had lied to me. Tonight I would find my
answer. And it came to me..

My vision was blinded by a radiant reddish-yellow light. Fire? It must of been
the flames of Deoch. A warmth begin to grow within my heart, one unlike I have
never felt before. It was bathing me in it's comfort. By now I had fallen to my
knees, my gloved hands graspsing at the mud ridden ground. I felt the flame if
inspiration flicker in my soul, like a raging untamed fire. And within my mind
the words I had been longing for were spoken.

"Always remember we are watching you. Keep steady your faith in us and
everything that you believe," those words wafted through my mind as if spoken
with a voice.

In the background I could hear the sounds of wailing. It was the utter disdain
of the Kobolds I had heard. My beloved, my wife, she was protecting me while I
looked for my sign. I could smell the blood of death touch the air: Kobolds
dying. All too quickly those sounds had vanished. The light had vanished after
those words. My vision returned to normal, and I could see the Pentagram once
again. The arms of my beloved held to me tight about the waist, her loving
support neverending. I could smell rapsberries,-- raspberries dusted with
cinnamon with the faintest hint of clove. Another smile touched my warily
painted lips knowing she was there by my side every step of the way through my
journey.

That scent - not truly a scent at all, but rather some essential radiance that
bypassed nose and tongue all together and plunged straight into my heart
- that essence filled me now, heart, mind, and soul. it was indisputable
evidence that she was truly, impossibly alive and in my arms, and not some
guilt-driven memory come to torment my dreams. And as if she knew I had
returned to reality, her soft, angelic voice broke the silence...

"Darling? Have you come for what you were looking for?"

"Yes, my love.. I have," I had said with a gentlness in my voice, "we may go
now."

In some ways, Vireyda reminded me of Bertil the Fae, back home in Suomi. Deoch
had given me my answer, my sign. So we rode off into the night, with my sign in
hand. I knew now that I had not been lied to that night. I will forever love
Danaan, and serve my lord Deoch with all the ferver of my soul.
