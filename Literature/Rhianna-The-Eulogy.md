# The Eulogy

_by Rhianna in **Dark Ages**_

Black wings fluttered in the blue night  
Even Glioca's warriors prayed for might  
Dawn threatened to never come back  
As the King's henchman put Yves to the rack  

Children, cowards, and mundanes ran  
While Dubhaimid destroyed as only they can  
Aislings were ripped from their dreams  
In battle, you could hear their dying screams  

Many loves and lives were lost those days  
Only brave Aislings stood to fight Chadul's ways  
Out of the blackness that was the sky, a light broke  
Within this ray of light, Goddess Danaan awoke  

Soon, within Danaan's embrace Chadul was found  
Humming a lullabye, the two fluttered to the ground  
Aislings present lowered their heads and wept  
For their lives, loves, and Goddess, who once again slept.
