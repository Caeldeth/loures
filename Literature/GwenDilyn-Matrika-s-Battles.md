# Matrikaâ€™s Battles

_by GwenDilyn in **Dark Ages**_

In the green watery lands, constant warmth stands.  
Numerous clouds attempt to stop the light, although not enough for all warmth to hide.  
Through the small clouds the mystic beams slide, to make the landscape somewhat bright.  
Ever-cold winds blow from the sea far ends, trying to conquer what constant warmth mends.  

Light undergoes a constant battle, trying to prevent the darkness to settle.  
Lasting rhythms of darkness wrong shall be corrected by a lightly song.  
In time one force is godly strong, lasting intensely for half a day long.  
Generally they constantly rattle like two opposing knights with arms of metal.  

Every day our sun feeds nature's creations with full care and lovely sensations.  
Never will she forfeit her honourable cause, not even with all the darkness that gnaws.  
Clearance of heart and soul she draws while trying to fulfil her mission without flaws.  
Even with Chadul causing endless irritations, Matrika shall provide us lovely light donations.  

In friendship she asks for assistance to protect against his evil resistance.  
Surely Glioca heeds her call since compassion is what she wishes all.  
All unsure for Sgrios's brawl, Deoch comes to the gathering hall.  
Gathered together for future existence, Cail joins in without any persistence.  

Rapidly they come to mass once a cycle of eight deoch pass.  
Ensuring a far lesser threat that otherwise aislings and mukul may have met.  
Arising so surely not to forget, combining their powers without regret.  
Truth shall be a special cause giving them style and worthy class.  

Gentle light shall bright their goals strength during their unique roles.  
Intensely fighting the strong malice shall defeat the darkness palace.  
Flames shall bite into walls of callous with colours of beautiful balas.  
Totally relieved in their godly souls, they leave her daily strolls.  

_Lady Dilyn, of Gwen_
