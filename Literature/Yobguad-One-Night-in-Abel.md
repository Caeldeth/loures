# One Night in Abel

_by Yobguad in **Dark Ages**_

Green were the trees as I walked to Abel town  
Blue was the bright sky above  
Dusty was my throat as I headed for the tavern  
There it was I first saw my love  

Blue were her clothes as she laughed above the crowd  
Green was the color of her hair  
Shining were her eyes as she danced by my table  
Then it was my heart she ensnared  

Green was the grass that night beneath our feet  
Blue were the waters of the stream  
Soft were her kisses beneath the starlit heavens  
Softer still than fine silk in a dream  

Green then was the potion she poured into my cup  
Blue is now the color of my heart  
Lighter were my pockets when I next woke in the morning  
There it was my love and I did part  

Green were the trees as I walked from Abel town  
Green as the color of her hair  
Stolen were my gems, my gold and my heart  
Let the foolish traveller beware  

_a tavern song by Yobguad Ababua_
