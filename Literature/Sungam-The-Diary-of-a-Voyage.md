# The Diary of a Voyage

_by Sungam in **Dark Ages**_

_30th Sun of the 5th Moon, Deoch 17_

Why do they say that the man is stronger than the woman, when even the most
gentle of women can bring a man to his knees without ever lifting her hand? Why
do they claim we have free will if we cannot even control what we feel for
others? Why am I powerless now, when I have felled any foe I ever crossed
swords with? I do not know what to do… Have to take some time to think...

_2nd Sun of the 6th Moon, Deoch 17_

I have made up my mind, I cannot stay any longer. I cannot bear to look into
Her eyes anymore. Not at this rate. I have posted a message to the Tuatha de
Deo board today, letting them know of my decision: I'll be travelling east from
Rucesion. I want to see what is out there - if anything. Honestly, I do not
think that is the true reason for my leaving… I need to be alone, need to
ponder this turn of events. There is no place in Temuair that does not remind
me of Her, I can no longer live like this. I am leaving as soon as the ship I
hired is ready. Hopefully it will only be a few days...

_13th Sun of the 6th Moon, Deoch 17_

So I finally did it... Saying goodbye to the Tuatha de Deo really took it out on
me. I did not know I was quite so emotional about them. The original purpose of
this voyage was to escape Temuair, but it just dawned upon me what I would lose
if I never am to return. For once I truly hope that I will live to see the
docks of Rucesion once again.

_13th Sun of the 7th Moon, Deoch 17_

It has already been a Moon since I left Rucesion. I haven't had time until now
to write in this diary... things got a little rough on the ship. It seems a
rather large part of the crew was not informed of our destination, and many of
them believe in legends of the Edge of the World being where we are going.
Being an Aisling, I seem to have their trust, though. At least for now.

Today also happens to be my birthday, as far as I know. It has already been 28
years since I was born into this wretched world. Although I usually do not care
much for this day, I cannot help being slightly fascinated by the fact that I
have survived this long, considering what I have been through. And this is just
another test... another test in the big game called "Life". It has been a long
time since I have been excited by one of these tests. But then again, it has
been a long time since I have been on a real adventure. Now the big question is
if I will survive this one as well... It is all in the hands of the Goddess, I
suppose.

_20th Sun of the 7th Moon, Deoch 17_

Another week has passed... still no land in sight. I am beginning to believe the
sailors' tales of the Edge of the World... but I have to show courage in front of
them. I have to inspire them. It is already too late to turn back... I am afraid
our food and water supply will not last long either... If there is land out here,
I pray that it is close.

_23rd Sun of the 7th Moon, Deoch 17_

Still no sign of land. Food and water supplies are running dangerously low.
Worse yet, the men are really starting to show fear. Even I cannot calm them
any longer... A fight broke out on deck earlier today. Three of the men were
killed before I could stop them... I cannot help but feel guilty for their
deaths... It was I who brought them here, after all... No use thinking about it, I
have to concentrate on the objective ahead.

_30th Sun of the 7th Moon, Deoch 17_

Another fight today. Two were killed. Still no land and soon there will not be
any water either. Our food consists only of the fish we can catch. I fear a
mutiny could start any day now... The Captain still trusts me, but none of the
men seem to have any hope left. Furthermore, I have just been told that a storm
is brewing. It looks like a clear sky to me, but compared to these people I
know nothing of sailing. I fear this storm could bring an early end to our
voyage if it is even nearly as powerful as these sailors claim it to be...

_1st Sun of the 8th Moon, Deoch 17_

The predictions of the sailors was true. A storm, a very large one at that, is
definitely underway. There is still no land on the horizon and I fear that our
ship will not hold up against this storm... I suppose it is the will of the
Goddess that I perish here. So be it, I was prepared for this outcome when I
planned the journey. I just hope I can be forgiven for bringing these men with
me...

_15th Sun of the 8th Moon, Deoch 17_

What a day... Our ship was completely destroyed by the storm, and I fear the crew
has gone with it. Quite a miracle that I survived. I remember drifting for days
on my own before finally losing consciousness... Then I awoke in this small
village. The people here supposedly found me on a beach, having drifted ashore.
I do not understand their language, but it seems they think of me as some sort
of God... my Hy-Brasyl Plate might not look quite as impressive as it did before
we left Rucesion, but I would think it is the first time they ever saw a man
cast in solid gold. No wonder they are impressed. Amazingly, this diary made it
through with only few damages. As did most of my equipment. My sword is
definitely not as sharp as it used to be, but I should be able to repair it on
my own.

I'll be using the next few days to attempt to speak with the natives... They seem
just as curious about me as I am about them. They seem to be friendly people...

_22nd Sun of the 8th Moon, Deoch 17_

I have not slept since I arrived here. The people are friendly and all, I doubt
they have any intentions of harming me, however, my instincts have not been
dulled by this voyage, and I am not comfortable with people I can hardly
communicate with. Apart from my inability to trust them, everything has turned
out fantastic with these people. Using body language they have been able to
tell me much of this place, and of their ancestors. It seems that Aislings are
awakened here in the exact same way they are back home in Temuair, and are
considered superior beings, much like the mundanes respect us back home.

They're somewhat primitive people compared to the Temuairan people. Their
houses are built of wood, but shabbier than those of Mileth. The tribe works
together to hunt for food in the surrounding forests, with some children raised
as hunters and others to take care of the village chores, such as cooking.
Surprisingly it seems this is not the first time they have had a visitor from
Temuair... I have not found out much about this person yet, but it seems to have
been a female Aisling...

_30th Sun of the 8th Moon, Deoch 17_

I asked that they let me help them with some of their chores, so I was allowed
to hunt with them. I have to say, these people might be primitive, but they are
excellent hunters. Even though they are mundanes, they are easily stronger than
many Aislings I have met. The animal life is much like that of the Eastern
Woodlands of Temuair, but there is just so much more of it, and the creatures
are quite a bit larger. I think I can learn much from these people... and they
are happy to teach me.

_15th Sun of the 9th Moon, Deoch 17_

It has been quite a bit of time since I last wrote in this diary. I have been
living with these people for a moon now, and I have been happy here. However,
lately I have been longing to see Temuair once again... Not just Temuair, I miss
my friends. At this rate, though, I do not see how I could go back to Temuair
even if I wanted to. I do not have a boat, and while I might be able to build a
raft, there is no way it could make the journey all the way back.

_17th Sun of the 9th Moon, Deoch 17_

I noticed something very strange today... I was taking a walk around the island,
to get to know my surroundings, when I noticed land not far east of here. I had
expected that there would be several small islands out here, but the land I
could see on the horizon was huge, more like a continent than an island. Even
more enthralling, though, was the colour of the sky on that continent as the
sun set. It is a very special colour that I have only seen in one place in this
world. The dying red light of Danaan, off the west coast of Suomi. That light
is not the same anywhere else on Temuair, or even here on this island...

_18th Sun of the 9th Moon, Deoch 17_

I asked some of the villagers today if they knew anything about the eastern
continent. To my surprise, they told me that the Aisling traveller that had
been here earlier had come from that continent. I am almost sure that continent
is Temuair! It has to be! How Temuair can be to the east of here, I have no
idea, but there can be no doubt. There is no mistaking that sunset. It does not
look like much more than a good 15 days of travel on a sturdy raft. I am going
to look into it some more in the next few days...

_25th Sun of the 9th Moon, Deoch 17_

I cannot believe I did not notice this before now! It is so obvious! The
culture here... their clothing, their meditation, even their hunting style! It is
so close to the Undine Monks that you could not tell one of these natives from
an Aisling Monk! Why they practice an art here that originated on a continent
they have never been to, I am not sure... but there can be no doubt that these
people have been taught in the same manner that the Undine people have.

_30th Sun of the 9th Moon, Deoch 17_

I studied the Monk-like culture of these people some more, and now I am
convinced that they must have been taught by an Aisling from Temuair. They know
nothing of Cail, or any other God, so they could not have been taught directly
from Him. If that female Aisling who travelled here really came from that
eastern continent, and if that continent is really the Suomi region, then she
might be the final piece to the puzzle. It is not unlikely that she taught them
all this. But it is strange... for some reason I am drawn to this culture more
than I ever was to the Monk craft back in Temuair... Or perhaps I always was
drawn to it, but would not admit it to myself as my loyalty has always been
with Warriors...

_2nd Sun of the 10th Moon, Deoch 17_

I have asked them to teach me. I cannot say for certain what has prompted me to
leave the path I swore to follow 12 years ago, but I cannot deny my instincts.
I just know that this is the right choice for me, I know it is the path I wish
to follow. It is time for a change in my life and I can think of no better
opportunity than this. I have already laid down my sword and armour, using only
my own body as my weapon. The coming days will be quite a challenge.

_5th Sun of the 10th Moon, Deoch 17_

This has to be the adventure I was looking for when I left Temuair! I feel as
if I have been born again! Using my experience as a Warrior, I have been able
to study the Monks' craft at an incredible pace. It is all so... "new" to me that
I am simply unable to let go. During the little time I do not use to practice
my skills, I attempt to build a raft to sail home to Temuair. The people here
have been very kind in helping me build it... at this rate it will be finished
much sooner than I will actually need it.

_8th Sun of the 10th Moon, Deoch 17_

This cannot be! Dubhaim! How... Why are they here?! They arrived out of nowhere
last night and raided the village. Almost half the population was killed. I
failed to protect them... The sacrifices I made when I gave up the Warrior's path
are still greater than what I have gained as a Monk. I will need more practice,
but I have not the time for it. I will take up my sword again, for the last
time. Until I am strong enough to do as a Monk what I was capable of as a
Warrior, I will not lay down this sword. I do not know how those Dubhaim came
here, but there can be no questioning their desire: to kill every living being
on this island. I cannot, and will not, allow that.

_10th Sun of the 10th Moon, Deoch 17_

The Dubhaim returned again last night, but this time I was able to hold them
off. I have decided to stand guard at the village every night, but in the long
run it may not do us any good... We cannot seem to locate the place of their
origin, and their numbers do not seem to decrease no matter how many of them I
kill. If this continues, we will have to track them back into their own lair
and vanquish them there... Knowing these beings, though, I am aware how dangerous
they are when their realm is threatened... It is one thing to fight the Dubhaim
on your own land, but to fight them in their dwelling is as dangerous as it
gets.

_20th Sun of the 10th Moon, Deoch 17_

There has been four more raids in these last ten days. We have decided to
follow those of them who flee during their next raid and kill them at the place
of their origin, hopefully vanquishing them for good. I just pray that I will
not fail now, when my years of practice as a Warrior might finally be of some
use.

_24th Sun of the 10th Moon, Deoch 17_

We did it. The raid last night went exactly as planned, with minimal casualties
on our behalf. This old sword of mine is still of some use, it seems... I will
surely miss it the day I choose to be a complete Monk. I am still worried about
these Dubhaim, though... We found a huge pentagram, exactly like the one in
Astrid, in one of the darkest corners of the forest. As I had expected, that
was where the Dubhaim came from... but something is not right. The pentagram in
Astrid only summons the Dubhaim if an intelligent being steps on it. The wolves
here might be cunning, but they are not intelligent as the Shamans of Astrid.
It is impossible that any stray wolf could have done this. There was nobody
else than the Dubhaim in the area when we arrived...

_1st Sun of the 11th Moon, Deoch 17_

I have had nightmares lately. Nightmares of Anaman, or at least a being
resembling him, like the one that appeared in Astrid. I do not know why, but I
am starting to believe that I am the one who somehow attracted the Dubhaim, or
whoever summoned them, to this place. Perhaps it is simply paranoia, but I
cannot take that chance. Every last instinct I have tells me that I am
endangering the natives here. I cannot risk their lives. Not after all they
have done for me. As soon as my raft is built, I will travel back to Temuair.
They will be better off that way.

_10th Sun of the 11th Moon_

The raft is finished. It is a bit shabby, but better than I had expected. It
should just get me over the ocean. At least I hope it will. I will be leaving
most of my possessions here, including my armour. It is too damaged to do me
any good anyway, and the raft might not be able to carry it all. The villagers
have asked me to stay for just a few more days and I accepted. I have come to
like these people, and even if I never learned to speak their language, I did
learn to communicate with them. I will most definitely miss them when I leave...

_15th Sun of the 11th Moon, Deoch 17_

Today is the big day. The day I start my journey back to Temuair. My journey
back home. I wonder how they will greet me... If the Tuatha de Deo still exists
at all. Do they hate me for abandoning them? Or will they be happy to welcome
me back, to see that I survived even this? Knowing them, I suppose it will be
the latter... that is just how they are. I suppose that is why I love them. I
have been given a chance to start a new life... This will be my greatest
challenge yet! I will not have any ink with me on this journey, so this will be
my last entry before I arrive in Temuair. I hope I will be in high spirits when
I lay my pen on the next page.

_1st Sun of the 12th Moon, Deoch 17_

It has been half a year since I last sat in this chair, at this desk...
Everything has changed so much, yet everything is just like it has always been...
They welcomed me back, as I had expected, with open arms. They are the Tuatha
de Deo, after all. One thing I just realised is that, even though I have been
all the way around to world, I only saw one island... I suppose I could have
drifted past an entire continent without noticing, though. I did not have much
control of where I was going, after all. After having seen this, though, I am
almost certain that there are other lands out there. Other people. Perhaps some
day we will make contact with them... Temuair is only a small part of this world,
and we have much to learn yet.
