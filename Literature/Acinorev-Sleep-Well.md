# Sleep Well

_by Acinorev in **Dark Ages**_

Be good little child, and do as I say,  
Do all of your chores, not throw tantrums or weep,  
Do not lie steal or fight, for such evil you pay;  
The Sgath will come take you when you go to sleep.

Be kind to your siblings, and others you know  
Be hopeful, not jealous, and humble, not vain  
Listen well to your mother, when she tells you no,  
For Sgath can destroy you, ere you feel the pain.

Now, you are an Aisling, so stand proud and tall,  
Be not beggar or fool, work hard and grow wise  
Give help when tis needed, be good most of all,  
For the Sgath hunt for evil within Aisling eyes.
