# The Descendands of Paex

_by Ardeo in **Dark Ages**_  

_(The following is an account that leads to the formation of a society of
mages, The Descendants of Paex. They have a strong affinity to the mana group
of fire, and try to remain faithful at all times to it. I, Ardeo, am such a
mage. This is part I of ?? in the group's history.)_  

## Part One

After the Shadows War, an eerie silence crossed the lands, as the world wept
for those lost in battle. Much was lost to the darkness, which had to be
rebuilt. A society of warbling humans would not be able to sustain itself, and
so those who lost little in the war, and those who were emotionally stable,
prospered while providing for others. It has been said that they were the ones
who leeched off of the misfortunes of others\-\- Many disagree. The successful
were, in fact, the saviors of our lands in a time of turmoil. Out of the ashes
rose families of power. Some searched in greed, for the very things that were
destroyed; but others, whom the light touched, found a utopia through kindness.
Unfortunately, "every light casts a shadow."

The Ryet'Lur family lead a prosperous life-style after the Shadows War. Just
beyond the realm of Mileth, a joy-filled family of four lived and thrived on
their farm: Terum, the headstrong father; Meyla, the protective mother; Rogne,
the bright-eyed daughter; and Paex, the witty son. Terum believed that his
family would be safe from the effects of an immoral society, by building beyond
the town. Although beyond the rivers, he could still trade freely with the
merchants from Mileth, as well as those who traveled from afar by boat. The
Ryet'Lur family had discovered the perfect plot of land to farm, the perfect
distance from town, and the perfect number of mouths to feed. If not for their
lack of news updates, perhaps all would have been well for the family.

The Grimloks, a tribal breed of dark creatures, were an ever growing threat to
the sanctity of the developing villages. Continually, something would come up
missing, from bread to child, and no trace of evidence would ever lead to the
culprit. But, as word generally does, gossip brought the tales of the dark
tribe to light. They were slowly growing in power, sacrificing that which they
found to their dark gods, and eating that which they stole... I urge you not to
ask which was eaten, and which was sacrificed, for there is no true
distinction. Nearby townspeople, including those of Mileth, drew together their
forces to prevent the Grimloks from attacking. So, in retaliation, the fiends
took to raiding caravans, and whatever else contained unprotected valuables.
Word soon spread, and the villages stopped their trade-routes all- together.

News of the sudden change was not fleet in coming to the Ryet'Lurs. Actually,
it was Meyla who first heard of the changes, those of which explained much of
Terum's odd behavior to her. Lately, you see, he had been brooding in deep
thought in his study. Daily, he would construct ways of securing their home:
Barring the windows, locking the doors, and pitting the land. Before, she had
dismissed these as precautions, put in place by a combination of excess in
money and time. Perhaps, Meyla did not even ask a single question of Terum,
because she had faith in her husband. A small minority tend to believe that she
wanted to protect what little time she had left, by instilling a false serenity
in the household. Either way, neither parent would let a tribe of sophomoric
creatures ruin their daily routine\-\- Rogne was still told to clean the windows,
and Paex was still sent to the general store for wheat. They would be done with
everything just before nightfall, and that would be that.

It was Rogne who first noticed the advancing Grimlok. Her heart beat steadily
as she witnessed one pair of beady eyes peer through the fence, casting an
orange glow upon its rungs. Her heart quickened as Rogne noticed tens... and
then hundreds more. She ran to her father's study, where she woke both her
father and mother. Her lips stuttered, but her eyes expressed all. Terum leapt
from his couch directly to the door locks. Fumbling over his own fingers, and
assuring himself that everything would be all right, he turned each one.
Letting out a great sigh of relief, surrounded by false security, Terum
returned to his family; however, something was terribly wrong.

There were no battle cries, no blood curdling hoots, no clashing of metal upon
wood. All was completely silent, as if the world held its breath in
anticipation. Then, it happened. What once was washed with darkness, was now
bitten at by red tongues of flame. The home, engulfed in flames, was now a
tomb. The family rushed frantically, door to window, but each exit was blocked.
Terum had made sure that no one could get in, and in his folly, had doomed
himself should he ever want out.

It was also at this time that Paex was returning from his errands, a bag of
wheat in hand. From a distance, the sky looked red with anger, and blackened
with defeat. Smoke wafted from the west, the direction of home, and
immediately, Paex's heart sank. As fast as his small legs could carry him, Paex
ran to his engulfed house. Flames danced upon its surface, much like the
Grimlok danced about the building in their archaic ways. They paid no attention
to the terrified boy, when he placed his hand upon a nearby window without
regard to the impending danger of the inferno. Unexpectedly, another hand
placed its palm upon the window from within\-\- It was Rogne's. An unnatural
warmth seemed to surge from palm to palm, mind to mind. Empathically linked, he
wished he could take the pain away from his sister, and so he did. Paex cried
out in agony! Millions of hot needles seemed to be trying to escape from inside
his frail body, but he suppressed them. Flame bit at his ankles, but did not
burn... No longer his enemy, but his captive. In the blink of an eye, his
family was dead, and the fire was extinguished. Shocked at the sight of such
power, the cowardly Grimlok fled.

They left the poor child lying on the ground, catatonic, oblivious to his
surroundings. No longer fighting a battle with the outside world, Paex was now
left to conquer the fire he had so readily taken in. His journey had begun so
early, that he did not have a chance to enjoy his childhood\-\- All the was left,
were the hardships of the future.

Forged in the depths of my mind,

_Ardeo Cum'Puneo_

(A poem I've written, in conjuction with the story. It has an Anglo-Saxon
scheme to it)

## Ancient Secret

Flickering upon the cheek of those I find,  
I wash over that which has been touched by darkness.  
Dancing where there is no music heard.  
Warming where there is no heat felt.  
Coming at a whim when I am called forth.  
I am the Ancient Secret, Creator of Worlds,  
Kept under false control, I bide my time.  
And when not watched, will bite my master.  
Yet, like a friend, I am drawn close  
To provide comfort and light your path;  
And then I am suffocated \-\- cut off.  
Dying, fading, no longer a cheek in need of a companion.
