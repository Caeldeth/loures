# A Temuairian Warrior Standing Tall and Proud

_By LadyKyra of _Dark Ages_  

It was Deoch 13, Summer  
I awoke at Riona's Inn.  
I was told that choosing a path in life,  
Was where I was to begin.  

I thought through the paths carefully,  
For there was no turning back for me  
The life of the warrior, yes that sounds good,  
I shall seek to protect the Temuairian neighborhood.  

My guide told me to stand tall and fight,  
To swing my sword with all my might.  
To Keallach, Mileth Warrior Trainer, I listened well  
For by my sword, many creatures fell.  

I adventured Mileth Crypt and the Eastern Woods  
Slaying hideous creatures and finding magical goods.  
There were also many quests I sought to achieve  
For I am a warrior, I will not see defeat.  

At the end of each adventurous night  
I go back to town, only to hear aislings speak of my might.  
They speak of how I have grown so strong  
Though I have not been in Temuair very long.  

I have succeeded in my own true quest  
I have honor and respect and am loved by the rest  
But I will not stop there; I'll continue to fight  
Protecting Temuair each day and night.  

I stand tall and proud for what I have achieved  
But much is yet to learn; and until I do, Temuair I will not leave.
