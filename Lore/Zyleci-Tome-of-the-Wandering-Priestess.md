# Tome of the Wandering Priestess

_Failte, Aisling._  

_My searches through many tomes in Loures has left me feeling that of all, the Octagram has no clear and well organized base for which any might gain knowledge or faith to a fellowship. I present to you my collections of notes and memories that tell the tale of worship, of the Octagram and more. Everything that has some significance and was in existence at the time has a memory to aid those seeking such. Now I please bid you, look upon the delicate dance of the gods in the Octagram. The basics are a listing of secrets, miracles, positions, and other helpful guides. From then I will write of each fellowship. Please, I ask you to continue on, learn what drives Mundane and Aisling alike, from the Peasant to the Noble._

_-Priestess of Temuair_  

`((All screenshots, drawings, and other information was gathered first hand all by myself around Temuair, from temple attendants, worshippers, High Clergy, knowledgeable Aisling, field tests of supplications and entreatment, and friends who braved dangerous places so I could get another screenshot. ^-^))`  

## The Basics of Worship
While different teachings come from different gods, all of them bid that the best way to worship is of a group, which is called a Fellowship.
There are eight fellowships, and each god represents a point on the Octagram. There is great meaning of how each god is related to one another from this holy symbol.  

By the relationships of the Octagram are set each singular god’s enemies, allies, and opposite. As an example, look at Deoch on the Octagram. Next to his point are his two enemies, Luathas of Gnosis and Fiosachd of swiftness and wealth. Gramail is his exact opposite, which fittingly is the opposite side of the Octagram from his point. To find two allies, trace from the God to the other side of the Octagram. As our example, Deoch traces to Glioca and Sgrios, which are his allies. Using this same process on the Octagram you may find out easily who are enemies with whom, their allies, and who their opposites are.  

## Degrees
A fellowship of worshippers is attached to each god or goddess, and has their own hierarchal structure. This structure is defined in ‘Degrees’ or rankings of the different kinds of Worshippers. This listing is from the ‘lowest’ considered position to the ‘Highest’ but the path up is not easy and requires much faith and devotion.  

### Worshipper
These are the core of the fellowship. Aisling and Mundane both show their faith and worship in a god, normally by undergoing the rite of initiation from a Priest or higher of that temple who then may choose to make them a part of the Fellowship. They attend mass and worship the deity normally once every Double-Moon. They are the most numerous, and with a proper relic (prayer necklace) can pray to give thanks for receive the blessings of supplications to their deity. The same is true for every member of the fellowship.  

(Each higher degree holds the same power as the lower degrees, unless otherwise noted)

#### Abilities:  
1) Prayers, Supplications, Entreatments. (Note: If your faith is above divine faith, it is best to entreat, if it is lower, a supplication is the most faith efficient prayer)  
2) Give Thanks: This is a worshipper gain faith and insight by reverently praying a day to their deity. The insight rewards vary from degree to degree.
Praise Another: This calls praise upon another pious member of the trinity in the name of their deity, and will raise the faith of the person praised considerably.  
3) Seek Guidance: A prayer given in the hope a divine image and lesson or words of wisdom from the deity will help the Worshipper through hard or difficult times with more teachings of their faith.  

If you are a member of a fellowship, you may also pray at an allied god’s temple for giving thanks, or other prayers.

### Acolyte
They are servants of the Priests and Priestesses. They have a greater understanding and higher faith in the deity than a normal worshipper, and are often times collecting enemy items for Priests, announcing a mass across Temuair, or assisting newly initiated Worshippers with basic theological or logical questions. While it differs from temple to temple, normally a task or religious geas must be completed showing their faith and aberrance to the deity before they ascend to this Degree. This position offers a few more abilities than a worshipper. This is the highest position one of any path but Priest may have in the fellowship. A mark on their legend will show which deity they are Acolyte of, and which Priest assisted their prayer to advance the Degree from worshipper. (Degree, Acolyte)  

#### Added Abilities:  
1) _(Deity’s name)_ Summon: this prayer uses great faith and summons minions of the Acolyte’s deity to protect the Aisling if harmed. There are three kinds of summons for each god, depending on the amount of faith of the summoner. Lowest faith of all summons will always bring forth rats. The mid ranged and high faith summons vary from deity to deity, and are described later in this tome.  
2) Lesser Desecrate: This prayer allows an Acolyte to take an item blessed by an enemy deity, calling upon the power of their god to remove the enemy’s consecration to the item. This takes one day of labor but can grant the Acolyte more faith in their deity. Once an item has been lesser desecrated it may be consecrated again to any Deity of the Octagram.  
3) Instigating Heresy: This Acolyte specific ability allows Priests or other Worshippers to be branded a heretic of the fellowship by oath of a lead and active Acolyte who must be forty-one insights or higher. The Acolyte must then have twelve supporting ‘votes’ from any other members of the faith, of any insights. Then the person targeted is branded a heretic and cast from the fellowship. This is sometime used when a Priest goes on a banishing spree of their home temple.

### Priest(ess)
They serve the Fellowship, Worshippers and Acolytes primarily. Priests are both Priests of their Deity, and of the Priest path among the Temuair paths. A Bard of Medenia may still hold their power as Priest or any position in the Clergy regardless of their new profession title. They have upheld the teachings of their deity and have either advanced to this degree by themselves from Acolyte, or have been assisted by a Priest in the Higher clergy. Priests assist all worshippers and allies of their temple who come to pray and pay their respects to the worshipper, and are often called upon to help with decision making

#### Added Abilities:  
1) Mass: This holy rite may be performed by a Priest once each Double-Moon. Normally a sermon, story, discussion, or other teaching of the deity’s ideas will be spoken, and after a prayer or ritual the rite will be invoked. The Priest may choose to have an assistant to the mass, to increase the invocation of the rite. An amount of insight can be gained from taking in part of the rite, depending on the faith of the Mass Priest. As the Priest can hold only one mass per Double-moon, so is it those who attend cannot gain insight or be ‘touched’ by that deity again until a Double-Moon has expired.
2) Consecrate: This prayer imbues the essence and blessing of a deity in an item that is un-enchanted. It takes an amount of faith proportional to a greater desecration. Seek a fellowship’s page in this tome for what the blessing of their god will achieve in a consecrated item.
3) Greater Desecration: This accomplishes a similar removal of an enemy deities’ blessing except the item in question is totally and completely destroyed. This form of desecration is a very effective way to gain faith for all Priests and higher. The item that will gain a Priest the most faith, an enemy deity’s prayer necklace, will also be destroyed, and offers a great boon of faith to the desecrater.
4) Initiation: The ability to initiate a Worshipper, Probate, or assist someone to Acolyte. A Probate is someone of ten or less insights. Once they are of eleven insights, they may become a proper worshipper. However, few Priests will initiate probates since the first circle is so short.
5) _(Deity’s Name)_ Order: The ability to summon the will of a god to banish any Aisling who is not a Priest or higher from the temple for eight Temuair day, or forgive that banishment. This also enables the admittance of fragile Aisling into the temple by speaking to the mundane attendant.

### Cleric
They serve both as servants and assistants to Ministers and High Priests, but also help to guide Priests and new worshippers alike. They have an ear to the fellowship at all times, and are able to relate issues of the fellowship to higher Clergy.  

To become a Cleric, the Aisling in question must be of Clave Recognition of a Mundane contest. The Priest must also have initiated forty worshippers into the fellowship to become a Cleric on their own. If they have assistance of a Minister or High Priest, only twenty initiations are need.  

#### Added Abilities:  
1) Creating a Holy Symbol or Holy stave: The Cleric will learn the secret of asking divine relics, symbols and staves unique of their deity. Normally to receive one or both of these items, a Priest or Acolyte of the faith must complete a difficult geas, or holy quest.
2) Slate Administration: The ability to delete and manage postings made on the fellowship’s slate, which are located outside of each temple, with exception to the temple of Sgrios, where the slate is also inside their shrine.

### Minister
They serve the fellowship by helping the High Priest(s) by keeping temple slates full of doctrinal and other religious writings that help all manners of Aisling and Mundane to keep abreast of temple policies, holy rites, and procedures for advancement such as Acolyte ship.

To become a Minister: Eighty initiations unassisted, with assistance from a High Priest, only forty. You must be at least Village Recognized by the Mundane to become a Minister.

### High Priest(ess)
They are the leader of the Fellowship. They serve all. Setting or helping to introduce the major guidelines of the fellowship with other Clergy input, they head the fellowship and emulate the teachings of their deity at all times and commonly hold the most visited mass each Double-Moon. They listen to all, and manage the Priests and other Clergy members. They have the great responsibility of having to decide who has fallen into malice and strayed from their deity’s path, when excommunication should be invoked.

To become a High Priest (ess): The Aisling must be at least Village recognized. One hundred-sixty initiations unassisted, or eighty if assisted by another High Priest or Priestess.

#### Added Abilities:  
1) Excommunication: This is the last resort used when a Priest or other worshipper has shown ill intent to the fellowship or great disrespect to the deity. The High Priest, with a Cleric or higher assistant may forcible strip all powers from an offender or heretic and have them cast out of the fellowship. Their legend will then have an orange mark, reading ‘Excommunicated by _(High Priest’s name)_’  

Now that the structure of each Fellowship in the Octagram is related, it is time to show what makes each temple different from each other in location, belief, and teachings. Turn the pages as you skip from temple to temple to temple, learning the intricate relationships between enemies, allies, and opposites. If you seek specific lore, as what the minions summoned of each deity, simply turn to the tab of that fellowship have been created for your ease of use. I hope my wandering from temple to temple, and Worshipper to High Priest will help to guide your path.

## Cail
Cail: The God of nature and Harmony. His domain reaches across Temuair to the very grasses. Son of Glioca and Ceannlaidir’s veiled conception; his great heart holds the strength of mountains. His father Ceannlaidir has forbidden him to bear arms, in fear that his own son would best him in combat. Cail chose instead to walk the path of Harmony, and unarmed fighting in tune with nature.

Location of temple: Undine

### Cail’s Allies:
Glioca: Cail’s mother, her love and compassion go hand and hand with Cail’s great love of creation and Nature.  

Luathas: His Gnosis- Divine knowledge or wisdom helps to guide the hand of Cail, and others to seek harmony. All sciences of Aisling stemmed from the observation and imitation of nature by Aisling and Mundane kind.

### Cail’s Enemies:
Sgrios: While Cail seeks that all things fallen help to create or sustain new lives, his desire for total decay and destruction lie far from the natural order or prospective of Cail, this focus is not within his path to harmony.  

Fiosachd: He who is of swiftness and knows wealth. His focus on things artificial is not in tune with the path to harmony.

### Cail’s Opposite:
Ceannlaidir: His father is honor and pride of a Warrior. His desire for combat and war place him on opposite ends of the Octagram. Cail is humility, and harmony.

### Special Notes:
Cail is the Patron God of Monks. To enter the temple of Cail, one must not be wielding weapons or armaments. One may also not wear boots in the temple or at a mass, as a sign of respect. Cail masses are held outdoors, near the fountain at the crossroads of the Undine paths.  

### Holy Relics:  
Holy Cail:  
Cail Symbol:  
Summons:  
Lowest Faith: Mantis  
Mid Faith: Turtle  
Highest Faith: Shriekers  

### Consecration  
Cail, the lord of nature, grants the great power and fortitude in his blessed items. `((+1 Constitution))`  

### Supplications/Entreatments:  
1) Protection from harm (Io dia armachd): This calls upon the great fortitude of nature, which increases the Aisling’s defense greatly.	
2) Honey: This prayer to Cail asks the sweetest of royal honey be placed in the Aisling’s pack. (It will read as raw honey, until identified)	
3) Great Stone Hand (io great stone touch): The focus and unbridled power of nature is imbued into the Aisling blessed by this entreatment. It increases the damage and severity of a Monk’s attacks by two-fold.	
4) Great Mist: Like drops or rain this entreatment places a more permanent agility and grace into the user’s stride, causing more chances for glancing blows and less damage taken. (This is a long version of the similar Monk skill, mist.)	
5) Cure Poison: This entreatment calls on the cures of nature to cleanse a poisoned and Aisling of taint. (Similar spell: Ao puinsein)	
6) Heal a Scar of Sgrios: You call the hand of Cail to remove the un-natural scar left by Sgrios after an Aisling’s return to the living. This can only be performed on an Aisling who has had no other scars healed previously in the last Eight Temuairan days.	
7) Songs of the Shrine: Holy scrolls that hold the ancient power of a return blessing. Upon singing the song on the scroll, the Aisling is taken to outside the temple of which scroll they have used. It will give the Aisling an amount of Undine songs based on their faith and if they were assisted.

Ceannlaidir
God of War and Great battles: Ceannlaidir is the most skilled warrior of all, and is at home with any weapons, from the most simple he can cast entire armies down in battle. His great love for battle and conquest are unquenchable. He is honor, a Warrior’s pride and gives his worshippers blessings of the fight and favor in battle.

Temple Location: Piet

### Ceannlaidir’s Allies:
Fiosachd: His quick and silent nature is beneficial to any seeking an upper hand on a great battlefield. As he is prayed to for luck, so to is he integral in the grand scale of battle. Luck is one of the most common aspects attributed to victories over many Deochs.  

Sgrios: Sgrios’s great hunger for the souls of fallen Aisling’s and destruction of all makes him an apt ally to the God of War. The conquest and grand battles of Ceannlaidir bring more spirits to shamble, War and decay hand and hand. Plagues are also common amongst the wounded soldiers of grand battles.

### Ceannlaidir’s Enemies:
Glioca: Her love for all things and desire to battle no one cast Ceannlaidir against her. Unable to tame her great compassion, he has disavowed any involvement with her since their union brought forth Cail.  

Luathas: Keeper of Gnosis, the divine wisdom, and the logic and wisdom of Luathas. His way of thinking holds no physical confrontation or great battles in mind. A search for intellectual balance has the potential to draw potential fighters and warriors of the path of a Grand battle

### Ceannlaidir’s Opposite:
Cail: His son’s path of harmony, nature, and humility are very much reversed of Ceannlaidir’s great pride, honor, and skill with all weapons.

### Special Notes:
Ceannlaidir is the Patron God of Warriors. To enter his temple one must be armed with some sort of weapon, for Priests and Wizards this includes staves, but claws will not suffice for the Monk. Pets generally are also not welcome by the Clergy of this temple.

### Holy Relics:  
Holy Ceannlaidir:  
Ceannlaidir Symbol:  

### Summons
Lowest faith: Wolf  
Mid faith: Goblin  
Highest Faith: Orc Guard  

### Consecration
The Lord of battles blessing on an item will cause the wearer to be granted added brawn. `((+1 Strength))`

### Supplications/Entreatment
1) Invigorate: Call the Ceannlaidir for the great blessing of holy speed and grace of movement to the group. (a long lasting mor beannaich-like spell)
2) Bless weapons: The shimmering essence of Ceannlaidir clings to the weapons of the Worshipper’s party for an extended battle; they slice, hit, pierce, and sting more potently with this gift of Ceannlaidir. (extended fas deireas)
3) Give strength: The hidden strengths of the Worshipper’s group are brought out for an extended length of time, as the muscles of even a Wizard will bulge with added brawn from this blessing. (Much like creag neart)
4) Primal fire: Summon the raw power of a warrior’s will down upon an enemy. (Likened to ard srad)
5) Dragon presence: The fire and fury of the dragon becomes one with the combatants in the group of the Worshipper who summons this great beast’s power. Great amounts more of damage and ability to land blows come from this power. However, the ability to sustain this takes great deals of vitality from the fighters, until the essence of the dragon’s power leaves the body. (The spell will take vitality down in ticks, until it reaches about 30-40 hit points, and will remain there unless healed or the spell wears off)
6) Massacre: A very dangerous spell, the secrets of this spell are only partially known, however, the burning desire to conquer within violently escapes the Worshipper’s body, guided by Ceannlaidir’s hand, and it is meant to destroy all enemies within site. This is not to be used lightly, however, and has sent many unknowing souls to Sgrios. (It seems that it is intended to drain your vitality and willpower to near death, but has been known to kill those who attempt. Do not attempt this if you are ungrouped)
7) Songs of the shrine: Holy scrolls that hold the ancient power of a return blessing. Upon singing the song on the scroll, the Aisling is taken to outside the temple. It will give the Aisling an amount of Piet songs based on their faith and if they were assisted.

## Deoch
God of the Aisling spark of creativity and imagination. Great dreamers follow Deoch, who was a dubhaim god of debauchery in the war of Danaan. After Danaan’s sacrifice, he sparked the first Aisling, and in tribute the cycles are named ‘Deochs’  

Temple Location: Suomi

### Deoch’s Allies:
Sgrios: While Deoch brings about the Aisling spark, he was once of dubhaim, and thusly still bears ties to Sgrios and his kind. Sgrios’s chaotic nature fits will with the wild creativity of Deoch.  

Glioca: She has a love for all things, and every Aisling spark that he has brought about. Daughter of Danaan, Deoch is drawn to her compassionate nature.  

### Deoch’s Enemies:
Fiosachd: Deoch opposes Fiosachd’s nature. It is in the seeking of most wealth and luck that is against the creative way. As a former god of dabachery, hording and cultivation of riches pits them as enemies.  

Luathas: He seeks the way of wisdom, but has no great spark for creativity and imagination. It lies in the actual plane, of hard factual information and research. The different ways Deoch and Luathas seek knowledge make them enemies.  

### Deoch’s Opposite:
Gramail: Deoch’s spark and creativity are a chaotic factor. He created the Aisling spark, which creates more souls who can and do choose to find ways to surpass the laws of nature and Aisling. Gramail is set in stone, Deoch dances in fire.

### Holy Relics  
Holy Deoch:  
Symbol of Deoch:  

### Summons
Lowest faith: Spider  
Mid faith: Gruesomefly  
Highest faith: Gog  

### Consecration
While wearing an item of Deoch, one feels the great uplifting spark of the Aisling amplified, and their vigor returns to them quickly. `((+10% Health regeneration rate))`

### Supplications/Entreatment
1) Heal a scar of Sgrios: Deoch’s associations with Sgrios and understanding how he scars the souls of those who visit him grant the ability to remove a scar from an Aisling.	
Remove Blindness, Sleep, and Curse: This brings a rush of feeling throughout the Worshipper’s body and group, expunging negative effects out of them in the process.	
2) Resurrection: If a person is facing death, a quick use of this supplication will revive them and prevent a trip to face Shambles in Sgrios’s realm.	
3) Regenerate my power: (io dia slan comlha) The great spark of creativity clears the minds of the group, and they will regain their vitality more quickly for an extended period of time.	
4) Furious Strike: (io ard nochd gar) Summon the power of ancient secrets, the worshipper emits a force that can strike all nearby enemies.	
5) Great Curse: (io ard cradh gar) A great curse upon those who would harm the followers of Deoch. The minds and bodies of any nearby will be scarred by the flame of inspiration.	
Songs of the Shrine: Holy scrolls that hold the ancient power of a return blessing. Upon singing the song on the scroll, the Aisling is taken to outside the temple. It will give the Aisling an amount of Suomi songs based on their faith and if they were assisted.	

## Fiosachd
God of swiftness, the ultimate slight of hand, and wealth. He is also of veils and shadows, and the most deceiving of the gods, but also values freedom and the ability to roam. He grants great bounty to those worshippers who bring him more power with their number. His power to cultivate wealth makes him the ideal God for many Merchants.  

Temple Location: Abel

### Fiosachd’s Allies:
Gramail: Fiosachd’s desire to continue wandering would be obstructed if not for the order of Gramail. His laws shield Fiosachd’s free spirit and he is allowed to wander.  

Ceannlaidir: War and great battles are hand and hand with the movement of mass amounts and use of wealth. To raise an army, defeat the enemy, or learn of a strategic location. These are all ways to gain coins in war and conquest, including smithing fine blades for great Warriors. The ability to logistically supply and gain profit from battles make them the most apt of allies. Soldiers also pray for great luck, an important factor of the Warrior’s battle, of which Fiosachd is known for.  

### Fiosachd’s Enemies:
Deoch: The spark of Deoch allows those willing to ascend luck, which is Fiosachd’s will. His spark adds an imagination and creativity that can cause fate or luck an unreliable thing to count on.  

Cail: His great love of harmony, nature, and truth pit him against Fiosachd. Fiosachd is the cultivation of wealth, swiftness, and these opposing focuses clash in teaching and practice.

### Fiosachd’s Opposite:
Glioca: Glioca serves all, and loves all. Her acts are selfless. Fiosachd’s acts revolve around personal gains, such as the cultivation of wealth.

### Special Notes:
Fiosachd is the patron God of Rogues, and one must have One-thousand coins or more on their person to enter his temple in Abel.

### Holy Relics
Holy Fiosachd:  
Symbol of Fiosachd:  

### Summons
Lowest faith: Rat  
Mid faith: Marauder  
Highest faith: Chest  

### Consecration
An item enchanted with essence of stealth and swift movement of Fiosachd. `((+1 Dexterity))`

### Supplication/Entreatment
1. Blind: Cause the enemies nearby to loose their sight. This will lay them open to attacks and other tactics very easily.	
2. Veil Group: The great silence of the shadow veil envelops the worshipper’s group. Those who cannot see through the veil will not know of the group’s presence until the veil is broken or the Aisling speaks.	
3. Bless Group: (io dia beannaich comlha) Fiosachd’s learned swift movements become instinct to the group for an extended period of time.	
4. Confuse: Causes nearby enemies to disengage from attacking their current prey, and attack the next thing they see, which is normally another beast.	
5. Charm: By divine use of veils, the nearby beasts can be enlisted to your aide, defending you with their lives.	
6. Find Wealth: A great accumulation of wealth, Fiosachd will award those faithful to his ways with even more coins and riches. When this is prayed, the Worshipper feels their coin purse become more weighted with extra wealth. (75,000 coins when supplicated and assisted by divine faith. Roughly 1/5 more when entreated and assisted.)	
7. Songs of the Shrine: Songs of the Shrine: Holy scrolls that hold the ancient power of a return blessing. Upon singing the song on the scroll, the Aisling is taken to outside the temple. It will give the Aisling an amount of Abel songs based on their faith and if they were assisted

## Glioca
Glioca is compassion and love. Her great heart holds no dark spaces or veils. She is daughter of Danaan, the sun. Her compassion and love knows no bounds, even for the evils of others. Glioca cares for all. The great empathy and love she is draws many Aislings to her worship.

Temple location: Mileth, seat of the new sparks.

### Glioca’s Allies:
Deoch: With great love comes great passion, Deoch and Glioca both have the great passion and love of the Aisling. He continues to complete Danaan’s work with each new Aisling, and the divine inspiration can be the guide to great gestures of love and caring.  

Cail: The lord of nature and harmony, his great heart and love for Temuair comes from his mother, Glioca, and also makes him Grandson of Danaan.  

### Glioca’s Enemies:
Gramail: Gramail’s order and law has no compassion, or love. It is without the most base emotions that Glioca is. He is indifferent, and ultimate neutrality, not caring as to Aislings who do not follow his set of order.  

Ceannlaidir: His wars and conquest bring death and pain, both physical and emotional to Aislings. He has love for conquest and battle, not others as Glioca does. Glioca wishes love to bring together, not battle to tear apart.  

### Glioca’s Opposite:
Fiosachd: Glioca serves all, and loves all. Her acts are selfless. Fiosachd’s acts revolve around personal gains, such as the cultivation of wealth.

### Special notes:
Glioca is the patron Goddess of Priest(esses). To enter her temple, one must not be armed.

### Holy Relics
Holy Glioca:  
Symbol of Glioca:  

### Summons
Lowest faith: Rat  
Mid faith: Frog  
Highest faith: Fae  

### Consecration
The item touched by Glioca’s blessing of compassion gives the wearer understanding of Temuair, and themselves. `((+1 Wisdom))`

### Supplications/Entreatment
1. Heal a scar of Sgrios: Call Glioca’s touch to warm over the scar placed on an Aisling’s soul after they have retuned from Sgrios’s realm.	
2. Protection from harm: Be surrounded by Glioca’s love, for an extended amount of time the blows of beasts will not harm you. (Roughly a 20 second dion)	
3. Resurrection: Seek to bring one whom is facing death back forth to life. This supplication must be used very quickly.	
4. Healing: (io ard ioc comhla) Ask Glioca’s touch to bear upon the group, healing vitality and injuries fully.	
5. Charm what stands before me: This will intoxicate a creature with love for the charmer, who will be protected by the charmed beast until the charm wears.	
6. Return to safety: Call the Fae of Glioca from hiding, who temporarily guide the Aisling’s spark to their home, where they reappear out of harms way, in their hometown.	
7. Faerie Liquer: Beothaich deum (reds) instantly appears in the Aisling’s pack, noticeably more when assisted.	
8. Songs of the Shrine: Holy scrolls that hold the ancient power of a return blessing. Upon singing the song on the scroll, the Aisling is taken to outside the temple. It will give the Aisling an amount of Mileth songs based on their faith and if they were assisted.

## Gramail
The god of law. His laws preside both over artificial (Aisling) and natural law. His laws act on swift justice. A lesser known deity, many politicians and enforcers of Loures pay tribute to Gramail, both Aisling and Mundane.

Temple Location: Loures

### Gramail’s Allies:
Luathas: Gramail’s studying of natural and artificial puts him well in line with Luathas. Luathas is the guide of this knowledge, Gramail whom applies it to supreme laws of the lands by use of similar logic

Fiosachd: Fiosachd’s desire to continue wandering would be obstructed if not for the order of Gramail. His laws shield Fiosachd’s free spirit so he is allowed to wander and cultivate great wealth unabated.

### Gramail’s Enemies:
Glioca: Gramail’s order has no place for the interruptions of compassion or love. It is without the most base emotions that Glioca is. He is indifferent, and the ultimate neutrality, not caring as to Aislings who do not follow his set of order.

Sgrios: While Gramail represents order and law, Sgrios is chaos and unrest. His thirst for the destruction of all and decay of souls makes him a keen enemy of the laws Gramail has set forth.

### Gramail’s Opposite:
Deoch: Deoch’s spark and creativity are a chaotic factor. He created the Aisling spark, which creates more souls who can and do choose to find ways to surpass the laws of nature and Aisling. Gramail is set in stone, Deoch dances in fire. Special Notes: To enter Gramail’s temple, one must be unarmed.

### Holy Relics
Holy Gramail:  
Symbol of Gramail:  

### Summons
Lowest faith: Centipede  
Mid faith: Crab  
Highest faith: Rock Cobbler  

### Consecration
Gramail’s knowledge and ability to forge the fabric of natural and artificial laws are sewn into his items, making the wearer more resistant to arcane magic. `((+10% Magical Resistance))`

### Supplications/Entreatment
1. Remove Enchantments (io ao sith comlha): This calls upon Gramail’s knowledge of the laws of magic to remove all ill effects on the party.	
2. Reflect Enchantments (io more deireas faileas comlha): This surrounds the group in a temporary magical field, which reverses the target of any first spell, beneficial or otherwise, back to the original caster.	
3. Step through space to home: Using Gramail’s great knowledge of the laws of void, this returns you back to the village you have taken residence in.	
Arcane scrolls: Pray to Gramail that he may gift you song from other villages in Temuair. (Randomly receive different kinds of songs)	
4. Songs of the Shrine: Holy scrolls that hold the ancient power of a return blessing. Upon singing the song on the scroll, the Aisling is taken to outside the temple. It will give the Aisling an amount of Loures songs based on their faith and if they were assisted.	

`(Author’s note: The supplication of ‘Bend Space’ was once known to Aisling kind, but it’s secrets have been barred by the Mundane for abuse of it’s power to transport someone randomly to a different place in the area ((map)) even into water.)`

## Luathas
The god those who seek great knowledge. Touched by Danaan, he is the keeper of Gnosis, knowledge of the divine. It is he who seeks to learn and make observations from all things, and it is common most researchers and Aisling scientists pray to him when attempting great new discoveries.

Temple Location: Rucesion

### Luathas Allies:
Gramail: His study of natural and artificial puts him well in line with Luathas. Luathas is the guide of this knowledge, Gramail whom applies it to supreme laws of the lands by use the same studious nature and logic of Luathas.  

Cail: His Gnosis- Divine knowledge or wisdom helps to guide the hand of Cail, and others to seek harmony. All sciences of Aisling stemmed from the observation and imitation of nature by Aisling and Mundane kind. The preservation of nature is important to them both.  

### Luathas Enemies:
Ceannlaidir: The god of great battles and conquest. His way of thinking holds no mental thought of avoiding or preventing battles. A search for intellectual balance has the potential to draw potential fighters and warriors of the path of a Grand battle, thus pitting knowledge, and brawn as enemies, to put it in the most base form.

Deoch: Luathas seeks the way of wisdom, but does not seek it with creativity and imagination that is the Aisling spark. His research lies in the actual plane, of hard factual information and research. This contrasts the rapture of Deoch. The different ways Deoch and Luathas seek knowledge make them enemies

### Luathas Opposite:
Sgrios: Sgrios seeks to destroy the knowledge and life that Luathas lives to study.

### Special Notes:
Luathas is patron god to Wizards. To enter the Luathas temple, one must be unarmed and be well learned enough to enter the sacred halls of Gnosis. `((Normally at least 7 intelligence can get lower insights through the entrance))`

### Holy relics:
Holy Luathas:  
Symbol of Luathas:  

### Summons
Lowest faith: Wasp  
Mid faith: Spore  
Highest faith: Polyp  

### Consecration
The keen mind and studious nature can be felt by those items that carry the name ‘Luathas.’ The wearer absorbs more knowledge and can withstand more mental strain. ((+1 Intelligence))

### Supplication/Entreatment
1. Know this Object (io meas comhla): The secrets of any item at the top of a pack become instantly know to the owner.  
`((Example: Holy Diana Durability: 2949/3000 Weight: 5 Damage: S: 4m20 L: 6m30, Armor: 0 Hit: 0 Dam: 0 Poet Level 19))`	
2. Destruction Ritual (io strioch bais gar): Use the knowledge of Luathas himself to invoke the power of an Aosidic power. This is not the full power of Luathas, however it is very effective on beasts in the area none the less.	
3. Great Storm (io ard athar gar): Call the power of the skies to rain upon your enemies nearby. This powerful attack will affect enemies in the immediate area.	
4. Awaken and Clear their Vision (io ceil leir comlha): The hand of Luathas removes veils from the party, cures blindness, stuns, and allows the party to see those hidden in veil and shadow for an extended amount of time.	
5. Inspire the Group (io fas spiorad comlha): The recitation of this prayer will cause the body to be drained of vitality so that willpower may be increased depending on the amount of injury a person in the party has already taken.	
6. Songs of the Shrine: Holy scrolls that hold the ancient power of a return blessing. Upon singing the song on the scroll, the Aisling is taken to outside the temple. It will give the Aisling an amount of Rucesion songs based on their faith and if they were assisted

## Sgrios
The lord of destruction and plagues, Sgrios resembles the dubhaimid. He has a great hunger to feed on the Aisling soul. It is also he who is responsible for the great plagues and famine that sometimes strike even great kingdoms. He has no faith in the will of Aisling kind. When an Aisling dies, it is Sgrios who grants the gift of return to Temuair, sparing the Aisling from Kadath for another time. The mark of Sgrios is left upon those who return from spirit by his guide.

Temple Location: Through the secret passages of Castle Dubhaim

### Sgrios Allies:
Deoch: While Deoch brings about the Aisling spark, he was once of dubhaim, and thusly still bears ties to Sgrios and his kind. Sgrios’s chaotic nature fits will with the wild creativity of Deoch. Deoch, his avatar enveloped in flame, casts the light of the Aisling, but this also casts shadow.

Ceannlaidir: Sgrios’s great hunger for the souls of fallen Aisling’s and destruction of all makes him an apt ally to the God of War. The conquest and grand battles of Ceannlaidir bring more spirits to shamble, War and decay hand and hand. Plagues are also common amongst the wounded soldiers of grand battles

### Sgrios Enemies:
Cail: While death is also Cail’s realm, all his is centered of the natural cycle, what once dies sustains new life. This rebirth and new life defies Sgrios’s will for destruction and decay of all things.  

Gramail: Gramail sets the law of Aisling, and protects many weak souls. Gramail is order, while Sgrios is chaotic in nature. Laws, and law enforcement stifles the will of Sgrios and his followers, and pits destruction, decay, and plague against the powers of natural and artificial laws meant to protect that which could be destroyed by Sgrios and his followers.

### Sgrios Opposite:
Luathas: Sgrios seeks to destroy the knowledge and life that Luathas lives to study.

### Special Notes:
To enter the temple of Sgrios, enter the castle and search the rocks to the north of the first archways on your left. If you are of high insight, the duplicated entrance lies to the northeast of the door with the Rucesion Adventure slate. If you are of too low an insight, enter through the doors northwest of there. Follow the hallway to the end, and search for the tunnel to Sgrios’s temple north of the final door.

### Holy Relics
Holy Sgrios:  
Symbol of Sgrios:  

### Summons
Lowest faith: Fiend Pupa  
Mid faith: Ghast, Nightmare Gaunt (Nightgaunt)  
Highest faith: Succubus  

### Consecration
His mastery of destruction and decay is imbued into items of the Dark Lord. Items holding the essence of Sgrios are less likely to dull or break. `((+10% To the item’s durability.))`

### Supplication/Entreatment
1. Puinsein: The taint of plague courses through any unfortunate enough to be in the immediate area of the worshipper who prays for this. It feels as poison, however as a plague of Sgrios it lasts for considerable time longer.	
2. Dhubh: When the dark force of Sgrios is called upon in the Arena, it will effect combatants in the area of the worshipper. Useful for when a large darkness attack is needed.	
3. Cradh: (ionad ard cradh gar) Curse your enemies nearby in the name of Sgrios. Powerful red spore clouds will seep through the skin of those in view.	
4. Spion Chadul: The awesome darkness of chaos is tapped into during an arena battle, causing all in the immediate area to bleed their vitality out violently. (Similar to hemloch, but much more messy)	
5. Spion Sgrios: Call Sgrios to leave his touch on the soul of an Aisling.	
6. Claim an Aisling’s Soul: _(You relish in ……’s death.)_ _Second: Their soul is not fresh (skull)_	
7. Songs of the Shrine: Holy scrolls that hold the ancient power of a return blessing. Upon singing the song on the scroll, the Aisling is taken to outside the temple. It will give the Aisling an amount of Rucesion songs based on their faith and if they were assisted

### The Order of Danaan
A non-traditional fellowship has begun to take root in the recent Deochs. Danaan, or the sun, mother of the Octagram sacrificed herself in the great war of Chadul and Danaan. She sacrificed herself so that Chadul would be banished to the underworld, and now a small group of thirty or so Aisling have started worship and service to her. It is Danaan who is the mother of Aisling kind. Without the standard temple of the Octagram fellowships, the Order of Danaan still meets for worship once every one to two Deochs. The leaders of the order are Priest Landon, and Priestesses Sandoza and Flyss. There are no recorded and set teachings of Danaan specifically; their interpretation is an ‘open interpretation of Her existence.’ The first Mass to Danaan was held in Deoch 35, and they continue to be held in the center of Suomi. The Order continues to have a good following, and has been successful at increasing awareness of Danaan since its inception. Those who wish to be Priest or Priestess of Danaan may not also be in worship of an Octagram deity, and picked directly by the Clergy of the Order. While rumors of special robes of clergy are true, they are seldom seen at places other than Danaan mass.

`((All information comes from my presence at their mass, as well as by personal interview and permission of Landon.))`
