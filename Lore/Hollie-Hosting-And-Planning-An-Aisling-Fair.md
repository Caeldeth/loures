# Hosting and Planning an Aisling Fair

_by Hollie in_ ___Dark Ages___

## Introduction

_So you are thinking about planning and hosting an Aisling run fair?  The information in this manual will help you along the way to hold a successful and enjoyable fair that is fun for all._

_Planning and hosting a fair is a large responsibility.  It is a lot of  hard work and one should not take on this task if  their heart is not dedicated to the tasks at hand.  The coordinator of the fair will spend all of their time dealing with planning the fair, scheduling events, testing features, organizing officials, writing announcements and posting them, and answering questions of event hosts, committee members, officials, and citizens.  Complete dedication and nothing less than 100% of what you have to give is required for the task at hand._

_The Mileth fair was founded by Dartanian, Burgess of Mileth.  Dartanian chose a group of volunteers to help him construct the fairgrounds and lay out the foundation for the first Mileth Fair.  Mileth Fair 1 was held in Deoch 9._

_Mileth Fair 2 was held in Deoch 11.   The planning of Mileth Fair 2 was different than the planning of Mileth Fair 1.  A group of volunteers joined together to plan the fair.  They formed a committee and elected one committee member to be the chairperson/spokesperson.  This worked well as it left the chairperson more time to take care of the structural and social aspects of the fair and make last minute emergency solutions to problems that can and will occur during the actual fair._

_Either way of planning a fair works fine either one coordinator or a committee of coordinators.  My personal opinion is that it is easier with a group of coordinators rather than one Aisling being responsible for the entire fair.   There should also only be one spokesperson that all members report to as to eliminate any confusion and prevent redundancy._

## Selecting a Committee

You've made up your mind and you are ready to commit yourself to the fair.  The first task at hand is to select a committee that will plan and host events.  There are many Aislings that enjoy planning events and carry wonderful ideas as their imagination flows.

Advertise the selection of a committee on the community boards.  The more members of the committee that you have, the better your fair will be.  Also, all committee members must be as dedicated as you are or they may leave you holding the bag when it comes to following through with their event that they have chosen to host and/or plan.

Once you have formed a committee, call a meeting.  During this first meeting the committee members should nominate and vote for someone to become chair person. The chair person will be responsible for all aspects of the fair as a whole as well as be the sole committee member that communicates with the mundanes.

## Responsibilities

### Chairperson 
(Also known as coordinator, scribe, and mundane contact.  From here on out this person will be referred to as the chairperson throughout this manual.)

1.  Planning and organizing meetings with committee members.  
    a.)  It is essential to pick a date and time that is convenient for all members of the committee to ensure proper communication with all of them.  Also, to ensure that all are aware of the plans and procedures in which you wish to carry out.  Teamwork is the key to a successful fair.  
    b.)  `((Hosting a discussion group outside of Temuair is also very helpful))` This eliminates the need to hold regular meetings and all can keep track of the progress and additions to the fair.  This also enables committee members to have access to all information that is shared between the chairperson and mundanes.  This discussion group should be left open for all Aislings in Temuair to participate in and keep track on what is happening with the fair.  Good suggestions can and will come from Aislings that don't wish to be directly involved in the planning of the fair.
    c.)  Recording minutes of ever meeting, keeping notes on all committee members and their progress with each event.  Keeping all members informed of the progress. 
 
2.  Contact with Mundanes  
    a.)  The chairperson is the only contact between mundanes and committee members.  All requests and suggestions of committee members must be sent through the chairperson, good communications skills are a must.  
    b.)  The Chairperson will ensure that all features of the fairground are working correctly.  The chairperson will immediately contact mundanes with any malfunction that needs to be fixed prior to the fair.  It is a good idea that the chairperson is able to hold office of Demagogue or higher during the entire process of planning the fair and hosting it.  
    c.)  All mundane posts and announcements will be written by the chairperson, good writing skills are recommended.  
    d.)  An outline of each event will be written in a single announcement and sent to mundanes in a timely manner.  
 
3.  Interaction with the community  
    a.)  It is the chairperson's responsibility to keep the community informed of planned events and to keep the excitement and anticipation of the upcoming fair high in the community.  
    b.)  The chairperson will be responsible for answering all general questions about the fair.   
 
4.  Scheduling  
    a.)  All scheduling of event times and days will be done by the chairperson. The best way to do this is make a blank time/day schedule and let hosts pick the time that is best for them.  If times conflict, some rearranging may be necessary.  
    b.)  The chairperson is responsible for submitting the final schedule to mundanes in a timely matter.

### Committee members  

1.  Each committee member will choose his/her event in which they wish to be in charge of.  
    a.)  The member is responsible for finding a host or hosting the event himself.  
    b.)  The member is responsible for finding cast members or contestants for his/her event.  
    c.)  The member is responsible for keeping the chairperson updated on the progress of his/her event.  
    d.)  The member is responsible for all advertising of his/her event. It is helpful to advertise your event on the community boards in each city that has this type of board. All advertising that needs to be done by mundanes must be submitted to the chairperson.   
 
2.  Event Prizes  
    a.)  If the event requires a prize, the event planner will be responsible for gathering that prize.  
    b.)  An entry fee for each event is recommended as this helps to make a prize fund which will be held by the chairperson.  All gold collected as entry fees will be distributed amongst hosts as needed.

## Brain Storming

Now that you have called your first meeting of the fair committee, what do you do?  The best thing to do is brain storming.  All Aislings have a spark of creativity in them.  No creative idea is a bad idea.  Encourage the entire committee to share their idea and suggestions openly with each other. Each member can build on another member’s suggestions.

To start with, you may think about all the options available in Temuair.  Mundanes are very helpful to Aislings planning a fair and are certainly willing to go the extra mile for a well thought out idea.  Basically, if a function already exists in Temuair, it can be implemented in another form in the fair grounds.  I.e.:  Special effects on the stages.

The areas available in the fair grounds for different events include:

+ ___Tavern___:  A quaint area for those to gather and purchase refreshments and share in fellowship.

+ ___Water fountain___:  Located at the entrance of the fair grounds.  The fountain is surrounded by park benches.  This is also a great place for small gatherings.

+ ___Event booths___:  These booths are available for Aislings to hold their own events, discussions, games etc.  There is a posting board near each both so that information about the event is easily accessible to all.  An event seal must be purchased for these booths.

+ ___Merchant booths___:  These booths are for Aislings to sale the many different items they have found in Temuair.  There is also a posting board near each both so that information about the event is easily accessible to all.  A merchant seal must be purchased for these booths.

+ ___Small stage___:  Located in the center of the event booths area.  This is a very small stage, only about 2 Aislings can fit on this stage comfortably.  It is ideal for stories, speeches, and auctions.  An event seal must be purchased to enter the stage.  

+ ___Track Area___:  This is a large area that holds a large track and a smaller track separated by a rope.

+ ___Summoning Arena___:  This is the only area in the fairgrounds where it is legal to use magic according to natural law.  The area consists of a large open arena.

+ ___Stage___:  This is ideal for plays and other events that involve a cast.  There is a back-stage area connected to this stage.  Only way on to the stage is through the back-stage door.  There are special affects available to the stage director which include magic and sound effects.  A director's seal must be purchased and the director must than accept cast members in order to access the back stage.  All special affects cost 1000 coins each to use.

+ ___Amphitheater___:  This stage is just like the other and includes all the same affects as the others.  There is no back stage to this stage.  Cast members must be summoned to the stage by the director.  Whispering is not allowed in this area so it is ideal for contests where answers cannot be whispered to others.  An amphitheater director's seal must be purchased to enter on stage and summon others on stage.  All special affects besides the summoning cost 1000 coins each to use.

This is also a good time to decide which city should host the fair.  Some things to consider when deciding the location are the number of officials within the city that can assist with the event and the amount of work and time required by mundanes to move the fair to another city.

A fair doesn't necessarily have to be named the same as the previous fairs.  The committee may choose to give it a different name depending on location.

Now that you have come up with a few ideas, it's time to plan them in detail.

## Planning Events

Some of the events that have gone over well in prior fairs are events that involved the interaction of the audience.  Aislings love to interact with those cast members on stage.  An example of some other events are as follows:

+ ___Sumo "throw" tournament___: Using the "throw" skill, Aislings battle it out trying to push each other out of the ring. It has been done two different ways.  One way is in teams of 3, each team member taking their turn to throw the opposing team member while other teammates recover their strength from their last throw.  Another version one on one, two Aislings battle it out.  There can be several rounds until you come up with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.

+ ___Summoning tournament___:  This has always been a favorite.  Each Aisling summons a creature from the God and the creatures battle it out, the last creature left standing is the winner.  Another version is Sgrios worshippers are hired by the host of the event and there is an Aisling v. creature battle.

+ ___Style show___:  This is always a fun event where Aislings show off all the armor available in Temuair. 

+ ___Play___:  Most loved event.  There are many writings available in the library that can easily be converted into a play.  There are also a few partial plays available.

+ ___Aisling Auction___:  Also another loved event as the audience gets to interact with the cast in making their bids.  Aislings sell their skills to others.

+ ___Trivia Contest___:  Mundanes graciously build a stage just for this purpose.  No whispering in the area is allowed so it is impossible for an Aislings to whisper the answers to another.

+ ___Scavenger Hunt___:  Mundanes also graciously blessed us with a King's Hunt during the fair, in which Aislings entertained King Bruce by bringing him items that he requested.  King Bruce's laughter could be heard throughout Temuair as one Aisling after another entertained him with their baubles.

+ ___Storytelling and Sharing___:  There are many talented Aislings in Temuair who love to share their life stories and experiences. Also, many that write other stories as well. There is never a lack of someone to tell a story.

+ ___Fair King and Queen___:  This is a difficult event because if there are several entries, then a panel of Aisling judges must be chosen to limit the finalists to no more than 12.   In the past, mundanes have noted that if there are over 100 couples entering, they would give 12/24 legend marks.   If there are under 100 than 10-15% of the total will be finalists.  If there are under 12 entering, all 12 may be finalists. If the total of entries is under 100, then only 1 legend mark is given.  Once the finalists have been chosen, mundanes will set up a community vote to determine the winner(s).  Legend marks are as follows:
    + ___1st place King___: Fair King with Queen <name>, Deoch x
    + ___1st Place Queen___: Fair Queen with King <name>, Deoch x
    + ___2nd Place Lord___: Fair Lord with Lady <name>, Deoch x
    + ___2nd Place Lady___:  Fair Lady with Lord <name>, Deoch x
    + ___All 3rd Place___:  Fair Noble, Deoch X

+ ___Mr. & Ms. Temuair___:  Lots of Aislings love to show off what they got. This is a good event to let Aislings strut their stuff on stage. An Aisling panel of judges must be chosen for this event.

+ ___Honored Guilds___: Guilds can be honored during a day of the fair and given stage time, many guilds can plan a unique event and enjoy doing so.  They can be anywhere from a talk show to an informational seminar about their specific guild, to games and other events. Guild members have been most helpful in planning their events which allows for constant entertainment during the fair.

+ ___Mock Wrestling___:  A ring made of coins where players mock wrestling each other.  Those that are acting involve the audience in the event.

+ ___Interviews___:  An Aisling plays the part of someone from Temuair's past and is interviewed by current Aislings.  For example, those interviewed could be Danaan, Chadul, Lord Tenes, or anyone that has been written about in history.  This is a good event to let others know the history of Temuair that is displayed in the Aisling Library.

Now that you have a few ideas and your group has come up with new and unique ideas, it's time to move on to the planning of each event.

It works best if the committee now breaks off into smaller groups, each group being responsible for planning the event they have chosen, seeking cast members and participants, writing up information and advertising for the event, and keeping the chairperson informed of the progress and any requests needed from the mundanes as well as providing the chair person with any announcements needing to be made by mundanes. 

## Setting the Date

```
((The fair has usually lasted one weekend, starting on a Friday afternoon and ending on a Sunday night.))

((In setting the date, it is important to work around holidays in which many players may be traveling and 
unable to attend.  It is also imperative to work around mundane schedule as they may have upgrades and quests 
planned that we are not yet aware of.))

Past experiences have shown that it is best to have al events pretty much planned and approved by mundanes 
prior to setting the date.  This eliminates last minute confusion and problems.  This also gives mundanes a 
chance to provide features requested of them and the committee a chance to test the features and work out 
the "bugs".

Once you have decided the date, ask mundanes to announce it for you.  The date as well as descriptions of 
events being planned should be announced immediately.  Another announcement should be made a double moon 
((1 week)) before the starting date.

It is suggested that the fairgrounds open at the minimum of 1 Temuairan day ((3 hours)) prior to any scheduled 
event.  This will give fair goers a chance to check out the fair grounds that they have anxiously awaited to see.  
It also allows for time for cast members to rehearse and do last minute planning.  After the initial excitement 
of the opening of the fair has worn off, you are less likely to experience disruptions and especially disruptions 
by those that have illegally received theater seals. 
```

### Announcements

It is important to keep the community involved and aware of everything going on with the fair, from the planning to the actual fair itself.

Each Aisling in charge of an event should be responsible for advertising for contestants, cast, and additional help planning the event if needed.  The chair person is responsible for posting information about the fair in general as well as answering questions and directing Aislings to the proper person that can answer their questions about a given event.

Announcements can be made on a number of boards throughout Temuair, though most announcements are made on the community boards.  Please be sure to follow the laws of each city when posting an announcement.  It is also considered rude to continually post the same announcement or advertisement.  `((spamming))`

All announcements needing to be made by mundanes must be given to the chair person to give to mundanes.  This ensures that mundanes receive the proper information and also eliminates confusion. 
 
`((Remember to keep all advertising in character.  URL and e-mail addresses are allowed but be careful of your  format.  When in doubt use the magical OOC brackets.))`

## Inspecting features

With all the planning going on, it is easy to forget that features in the fairgrounds need to be tested.  This is especially true of new features.  It is the chairperson's responsibility to make sure all these features are tested prior to the fair.  A Demagogue, Burgess, or Judge may enter the fairgrounds prior to the fair to test these features.

This section is a check list to help make sure all features are tested and nothing forgot.  Be sure to test...

+ Any new feature completely.  
+ The time allotments on seals to be sure they last the amount of time they were issued for.  
+ Each booth to be sure they can be entered and exited.  
+ All boards to be sure they are accessible.  
+ All mundanes located throughout the fair.  
+ The ability to give a non-official permission to sell seals.  
+ The ability to summon cast members to the fairgrounds prior to the fair opening so they may rehearse.  
+ Amphitheater  
    + Summoning on to stage  
    + Removing from stage  
    + Whispers not allowed  
    + All special affects  
    + Ability to remove someone from the area  
    + Length of director's seals for amphitheater  
    + Audiences ability to leave the area by mundane request in case they are blocked in.  
+ Stage  
    + Director can admit cast  
    + Length of time director's seals last.  
    + Length of time cast members assignment lasts.  
    + All special affects  
    + Ability to remove someone from the area  
    + Audiences ability to leave the area in case they are blocked in.  
+ Make sure it is possible to use prayers and spells in the summoning arena.  
+ Make sure that spells cannot be used in other areas.  
+ Make sure the "warp" feature in entrances cannot be abused.  
+ Make sure once an Aisling has been removed from an area, they cannot enter again immediately.

Any problems found should be reported to the chairperson so they may inform the mundanes and allow for them to be corrected prior to the opening of the fair.

## Mundanes

There are numerous mundanes located in different areas inside the fairgrounds to assist you.

The mundane located inside the main office of the fairgrounds will assist with issuing seals as well as politics and law enforcement.

The banker is also located inside the main office.

There are many mundanes located throughout the fair grounds to help guards with enforcing the law.

Also, in the two stage areas, the mundanes allow recognized teachers to assist with keeping the area free of disturbances.

## Organizing Officials

### Guards

A senior Guard or Guard Captain should be chosen to organize guards and their designated duties throughout the fair.  Only the guards of the hosting city may enforce law in the fairgrounds.  The governing laws of the fairgrounds are those of the hosting city.

Guards are not only needed to patrol the fairgrounds, they are also needed to issue seals.  There is a mundane located in most areas of the fairgrounds to assist a guard in enforcing the laws.

A leading guard may wish to schedule working time in the fairgrounds for each guard.  That way each guard will be responsible to assist during the fair but may also have time to enjoy the fair.  The schedule may be posted throughout the fair so that other's may know which guards to contact for seals and other problems.

Communication between all guards is a must so that they may determine habitual offenders and be aware of them.  They should also make those issuing seals aware of any Aisling abusing their seals or of any official giving seals to habitual abusers. 

### Demagogues

A Burgess or senior Demagogue may wish to also create a schedule for those that will be available to issue seals and make the schedule available to the public.  While the guards do most of the law enforcement of the fairgrounds, the Demagoguery will be issuing a majority of the seals.

Currently, at the time this was written, Mileth holds a law regarding conduct at the fairgrounds.  That law can be read in the Laws/Criminals section of this manual.

The Demagoguery may wish to expand on this law or write a new one and post it throughout the fairgrounds at the start of the fair.

The leading guard and leading Demagogue should report to each other so that each branch is aware of any problems and concerns.  A report at the end of each Temuairan day should be submitted to each leader.  In closing, cooperation, communication, and teamwork between both government branches will lead to a peaceful fair with little disturbances. 

## Laws and Criminals

As stated before, the laws of the hosting city are in effect on the premises of the fairgrounds and should be strictly enforced.

A majority of the crimes seen during the fair is theft and disruptions.

In the event of a disruption, first ask the Aisling to stop and give warning of the punishment that will be enforced if they do not.  If the disruption continues, a teacher may be able to remove them from the area temporarily.  If not, they should be banished or exiled for the duration of the fair at least.  This will prevent any further disruption from that Aisling.

For theft, if possible, have a rogue that has the ability to "peek" take a look inside the pockets of the alleged thief to determine if they do have the item.  Try to talk them into giving the item back.  If they refused, the should be punished immediately under the hosting city's laws.

Peasants are a bit of a different story.  Many Aislings hire peasants to break the laws and cause disruptions during the fair.  Currently, peasants should not be able to purchase seals of any kinds though this should be tested.  This should reduce the thefts from "hiding" peasants.  Peasants with offending names should be banished on site as they are just there to create a disturbance.

Any official that knowingly issues seals to a criminal should also be looked at as a criminal and immediately removed from office by other officials.  The committee planning the fair should make those issuing seals aware of the Aislings that may purchase director's seals.  Director's seals should not be sold to anyone without prior permission of the planning committee.

The current law for the fairgrounds is as follows and may be used as an example for any additional laws. 

|Mileth Fairground Conduct|
|-|
|All visitors in the Mileth fair grounds are expected to behave properly.  Disrupting any event, theft, and other rude or dishonest conduct shall be punished immediately.  All those disrupting any performance taking place during the fair shall be banished/exiled for the duration of the fair, there will be no second chances.  Said Aisling will not be permitted to reenter the fairgrounds.  Upon the closing of the fair, said Aisling may have their exile forgiven. <br><br>All officials of Mileth are expected to abide by this law and enforce it, failure to do so will result in your banishment.  All officials are expected to give out seals to those that can be trusted with them.  Any official authorizing a seal to someone who abuses shall be banished from Mileth and not permitted to enter the fair grounds. <br><br>Director's seals may ONLY be authorized to those appearing on the Mileth Fair schedule.  Any Aisling obtaining a director's seal without authorization of the Mileth Fair Committee shall be banished/exiled from Mileth for the duration of the fair. <br><br>Please govern yourselves accordingly, <br><br>Hollie Ileen <br>Mileth Fair Committee <br>-enacted per right of Burgess|

## Issuing Seals

Both branches of government may issue seals and may also designate a trusted citizen to issue seals.

Care should be taken when issuing seals.  No seal of any kind should be issued to an Aisling that is known to disrupt or steal from others.

If in doubt about issuing a director's seal, please check with a fair committee member to be sure the individual has approval for such a seal.  If in doubt about issuing any seal, wait until you are sure.

Be courteous to an Aisling requesting a seal, ask them which type of seal they would like and how long they would like to purchase the seal for.  The seals available and their prices are as follows: 
  
|Seal|Length|Cost|
|-|-|-|
|Merchant Seal|8 hours ((1 hour)) <br>1 day ((3 hours)) <br>1 week ((21 hours)) <br>1 moon ((3.5 days))|1,000 gold <br>5,000 gold <br>15,000 gold <br>30,000 gold|
|Event Seal|8 hours ((1 hour)) <br>1 day ((3 hours)) <br>1 week ((21 hours)) <br>1 moon ((3.5 days))|1,000 gold <br>5,000 gold <br>15,000 gold <br>30,000 gold|
|Theater Director Seal|8 hours ((1 hour)) <br>1 day ((3 hours)) <br>1 week ((21 hours)) <br>1 moon ((3.5 days))|25,000 gold <br>50,000 gold <br>125,000 gold <br>250,000 gold|
|Amphitheater Director Seal|8 hours ((1 hour)) <br>1 day ((3 hours)) <br>1 week ((21 hours)) <br>1 moon ((3.5 days))|25,000 gold <br>50,000 gold <br>125,000 gold <br>250,000 gold|

If at all possible, someone should be in the office at all times to issue seals.  This is where a schedule of workers would come in handy.  Be sure to have someone available to issue seals during prior to the start of each scheduled event.  It is the planning committee’s responsibility to make sure those seals are issued to the event hosts. 

## Event Ideas

Besides the ideas that have previously been discussed, there are thousands of possibilities for individuals as well as guilds to hold events.  Some of the suggested events and past events are as follows:
 
+ Guild Orientation/discussion  
+ Path demonstration and discussion  
+ Craft demonstration  
+ Debates  
+ Poetry readings  
+ Dances  
+ Parties  
+ Fortune telling  
+ Portrait making  
+ Match Making - find a perfect partner  
+ Interviews  
+ Small skits

The possibilities are endless and couldn't possibly be listed in their entirety.  Use your Aisling spark and imagination to come up with various ideas.

## Gaming Ideas

We have seen numerous game ideas and variations of ideas in the past.  The ideas and variations are endless and include guessing games, hiding games, gambling games, and numerous others.  Here are a few examples: 
 
+ ___Guess the name of the potion___:  Pick several potions of the same color and have the player guess which potion it is.  
+ ___Find the gem___:  Lay out 2 pairs of earrings and a gem and have the player guess which one is the gem.  
+ ___Guess the number of items___:  Drop several items in a pile and the player guessing the correct numbers wins.  
+ ___Gambling___:  Drop a number of items in a pile, have the Aisling guess the correct number and make a bet on their guess.  
+ ___Hide and Seek___:  There are many places throughout the fairgrounds where individuals may hide.  
+ ___Leap Frog___:  This is an event that can be played by monks with the appropriate skill.  
+ ___Polishing Game___:  An event that can be played by rogues to see who can polish the most gems in a given time.  
+ ___Wolf's bane___:  Several Wolf's skins are laid out, the team picking up the most wins.  Another variation if to have an equal number of skins on each side of a line, each team must try to either take the skins from the others side and drop them on their side or try to get all the skins on the opposite teams side.  This game would need a time limit.  
+ ___Spin the Aisling___:  The Aislings stand on a coin and spin as fast as they can, trying not to fall off the coin.  The last Aisling standing on the coin wins.  
+ ___Trivia contests___:  Ask a variety of questions on Temuair or different paths and their abilities.  A variation of this is to have couples work as a team, one answers the question and the other has the ability to agree or disagree with the answer.  

There are also many possibilities and variations of games.  Use your imagination and see what you come up with.  Games are enjoyed by everyone and are a very important part of the fair.  Those running a game not only have a chance to earn some gold, but also have fun doing it.

Having a good prize for a game is important for attracting customers.  Plan ahead and gather some of the most wanted items or have lots of gold on hand.  If you have an entry fee, make sure it is reasonable according to the item won.

There is a board located near each event booth where the game directions and rules can be written.

May your imagination and creativity flow and bring you good luck with your game!! 

## Selling Items

Holding a merchant's booth can be tricky but still rewarding.  Merchants have worked hard to obtain items and sell them to the public.

As a merchant, there are some precautions you should take to ensure the security of your hard-earned items. 

+ Never lay them in a place where another can pick them up.  
+ Don't display expensive items.  
+ Make good use of the boards near your booth to list your items.  
+ Never let someone you don't know hold and examine the item.  
+ Know the guard on duty and report all thefts immediately.  

There are many items that sell quite well and are highly thought after.  When deciding which items to sell, consider items needed for protection and gaining skills.  Also, think of items that may be needed for the King's Hunt which is held in Loures during the fair. 

## Problem Solving

Many problems can and will arise during the fair.  However, if you have followed the instructions given, these can be minimized.  When a problem arises, work together to solve it, there are many resources available to solve minor problems that occur.  There are also many steps that can be taken to avoid problem.

+ Always have back up Aislings available for each event.  It may even become necessary to enlist your siblings.  
+ The chair person should be available to assist in every event and help find last minute replacements when needed.  
+ Plan ahead and pool your gold so there is plenty of prize money for planed events.  Use entry fees towards prize money.  
+ Have extra gold on hand to reimburse an Aisling who has bought a seal and is unable to use it.  Though this is not the committee’s responsibility, the problem does arise where a seal is sold and there is no available booth.  
+ Write to mundanes immediately when finding a "bug", this should be minimal if all features have been tested prior to the fair.  
+ Deal with disturbances and thefts immediately, don't allow it to continue or go easy on the criminal.  Be aware of sibling offenders.  
+ Improvise when needed.  If one area holds a significant error, move the event to another area.  
+ Don't limit your committee, allow every Aisling to become a part of it if they wish.  Encourage others to join, someone may just be waiting to be asked to become a part of it.  
+ Never criticize another's ideas, all ideas are good ideas.  
+ Work together with all involved and put your personal feelings aside.  Don't try to hurt another by crossing your boundaries and stepping on their toes, you could lose a valued assistant.  
+ Enlist the assistance of previous committee members, they hold great wisdom and guidance as they have already experienced and carried out what you have just started.  Their wisdom could prove to be beneficial to the current committee.  
+ Always remember, this is the community's fair, not the committees.  Without the attendance of the community, there would be no fair.   
+ No one person should take credit or blame for anything.  This is a team effort and all are responsible from the chairperson, mundanes, committees, event leaders and the fair goers.  

Guilds may be included in the fair to host and plan events or even just to be recognized, but the fair as a whole should never be considered a guild planned event.

### Events that require voting

It is almost impossible for the community to vote on a large number of contestants.  A vote or panel of judges may need to be set up to pick finalists in the event of a large number of entrants.  The mundane burgesses have assisted and been no the panel of judges in the past. 

A panel of judges should be a mixed group with diverse paths, insights, and opinions.  If the vote takes place outside of Temuair, all votes should remain closed with one individual accepting all votes and another receiving a copy of those votes.  This keeps the influence of others from interfering with one's vote.  The final results should than be tallied and sent to mundanes.  A copy of all votes should be available upon mundane request to determine the fairness of the individual counting the votes.

If the vote takes place by a panel of judges within Temuair, it can be done through discussion and agreement or through mailing or whispering votes to the lead judge.  Votes through whisper can be verified with memories and journals.

Most Aislings that are planning a fair have the best interest of the community at heart or they would not be planning the fair in the first place. 

Any Aisling entering a contest or having siblings in a contest should be excluded from the panel of judges. 
  
### Timeline

|Time|Action|
|-|-|
||Make announcement seeking committee members and start planning.  Once you have an outline of all events, all events have a host, and mundane approval set the date.|
|((4-6 weeks before the fair))|Start taking submissions for contests and posting them for community view.  i.e. drawings, stories, essays, poems, etc. <br><br>Play should be written and cast should begin rehearsing, ask mundanes to open fairgrounds to officials and those that need to rehearse.  Begin testing features in the fair grounds. <br><br>Ask mundanes to gossip about fair events, give descriptions of each event. Include information on seal pricing, event hosts, information outside of Temuair and how to enter contests.|
|((3 weeks before the fair))|For Aisling judges:  Any pre judging needing to be done before a community vote is set up by mundanes should begin now, it can take time to get all votes. Allow a week for judges to decide.|
|((1-2 weeks before the fair.))|Community votes controlled by mundanes should begin now and last 7-10 days.|
|((1 week before))|Final walk through and testing of all features. <br><br>Ask mundanes to gossip about the final schedule of events.|
|((2 days before))|Hold a meeting with all officials, explain what is expected of them and the consequences that could happen should one not use care when issuing seals.|
|((1 hour before))|All officials working the fair should gather in the fairgrounds for a short meeting.  Be prepared for a massive amount of Aislings wishing to purchase seals during the first day of the fair ((3 hours)).  At least 4 officials should issue seals and at least 2 guards should patrol each area.  The two stages may be patrolled by teachers that don't necessarily hold office.|

## Closing the Fair

The closing of the fair can either be a grand event or a relaxed event.  Previous fairs have ended it with a play or just with a quiet story telling event.  Having no event at closing is also accepted.

There are no special things that need to be done in closing the fair grounds.  Mundanes will lock the gates to the fairgrounds a few days after the close of the fair.

Once the fairgrounds have closed, it is a good idea for the chairperson to write a follow-up report to mundanes.  The report should contain information on problems as well as suggestions and notations of all the good things that took place.

A Thank you may be written by the committee chairperson or by a mundane burgess on request.

May your fair be a successful one and bring love and happiness to all that seek to enjoy what the fair organizers and mundanes have worked so hard to provide.

Best of Luck in planning this fair!
