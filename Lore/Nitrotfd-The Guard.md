# The Guard: The Protector of Aislings

_by Nitrotfd in_ ___Dark Ages___

## Introduction: How to be a guard

The art of Guardsmanship is a delicate one. You must know every law, have it all memorized in the back of your mind waiting to be let out. You must obey the laws at all times and never be judgmental, always remain un-bias no matter what the case it. When presented with a problem, hear out all sided of the story and make a decision. If the decision is too difficult, consult a Guard Captain or a Judge. Even another guard may help you out, don't be afraid to ask, remember you are a guide and protector to these people, do anything to seek justice. Read and memorize any guard standards laws and especially read the guard conduct laws if you are a Mileth Guard. Once you have gained focus, bear your tabard and set out to bring justice to these dark ages...

### Proper Guard Etiquette

Always stay focused in your goal and don't be wavered by those who want to manipulate their way out of things. Keep your temper in check and always explain what is not understood. If you cannot explain, don't panic, ask another official for help. Never take sides in 2 cases, it doesn't matter if it is your best friend and your worst enemy, be un-bias at all times, it is your duty, don't abuse it. Never deal punishment for personal reasons or self-gain. Always make a report of all banishments you have. Once again, read guard procedure laws especially the Mileth guard conduct law. Don't be bias because of someone's companions or the guild he is in, you don't know him so don't judge him, and even if you do know him, remain un-bias at all times. Try to obey this basic etiquette and your guardsmanship can be refined to new levels as you go along.

### Handling Trouble Makers

Let’s put it this way, when Deoch made the Aisling, some of the ones that he got weren't what he had in mind. Like all orchards there is a bad apple; every vine has a rotten grape and every community has a troublemaker. Let’s take an Aisling for example I have grown to detest over the Deochs: Zeken. He looks normal (to an extent) he seems normal (when he's asleep) and he... OK, hold up right there. This is an assumption of a non-experienced guard.

Behaviors of a troublemaker can be seen as profanity, sexual and non-sexual harassment. Acting like one is on a combination of hemlock and nila dust all packed into one thing, a trouble maker. These Aislings don't care about others and like to get a reaction from guards and officials. Stay in a professional manner but it doesn't hurt to show him up a little, but that is off the record and not normal procedure (ex. Zeken asks me to kiss his arse and I reply telling him to wipe it first, course this is not normal procedure, I just like to show up troublemakers, make them feel less invincible). When a trouble maker comes watch for heresy and profanity. 
If he is a troublemaker and you know it, give only 2 warnings for heresy and one for harassment (Mileth laws) after that dispose of him ASAP, chances are he will possess another Aisling's body and do the same thing. Do the previous procedure about three times, then just ban when you recognize him. By then you may stop writing reports. Other trouble makers are high insight and will make you lose your temper than outwit you on laws. Just ignore them, although they are troublemakers they don't use immature techniques as the ones described above do. Ignore them and they'll get bored and leave.

### Seeking Help

Every guard has a time in their life when they can't handle some of these things alone. Whether it be understanding a law, or handling a troublemaker, one of these days you will need help. Solution: ask for it. Almost all guards will help with the understanding of laws. If they know it themselves, they will explain it in better perspective. Ask for veteran guard's help (about 3-4 guard terms) or ask a Guard Captain/Judge. When it is the understanding of a law you can pretty much ask anyone.

When it comes to handling Aislings, ask a fellow guard unless this is a particularly serious case that needs the insight of a guard captain. If none of the above work, stall and read the laws while he is telling you needed information, the Aislings don't need to know that you do not understand the laws they have based their case on, as always read the laws so that this situation hopefully doesn't come.

## Advancing Guard Skills: Dealing With Advanced Cases

Not all cased require a look at, making a decision and dishing out punishment. In cases such as theft and harassment, evidence and witnesses will be required. First off, get witness names. Second, ask the Aisling to mail you his/her memories `screenshots` by `E-mail`. While the Aisling is doing this (the he/she has memories that is) speak to the witnesses about the situation and what they witnessed. If you notice a long-awaited pause before an answer tell him and the complainant (if he isn't mailing memories) to ignore whispers `F4`. They may be making up this story as they go along through whispers and if you disable this, you can find nooks and crannies in their story. Also, if this is the case, separate them in 2 areas.

Every once and a while try to whisper them and make sure they can’t hear you. If they can hear you, crack down on them about how they are incriminating themselves by doing this. If it happens a second time, demand an explanation and you decide if it is sufficient enough to not throw their case out the window. Also speak with the accused Aisling in an advanced case. Hear both sides and get the accused memories and witnesses in the same manner as you did the accuser. Review the witness reports and the memories and finally do the hard part, make the decision Look for loopholes in the stories and take into consideration what the memories really show. Do this and you can make a case over. Lucky you, now you get to do another case soon enough.

### Who's Lying and Who's Telling the Truth?

Ah yes, the good ol' your word against mine situation. No legitimate witnesses. Inconclusive evidence (note this situation only comes in a case that evidence/witnesses are not required, just recommended) and both sided have a completely different story to what happened. What do you do? Separate them. Ask them exact same questions and look into answers. If there is a somewhat of a pause, take that into consideration, he may have to think about his answer but also take into consideration his speaking speed. He may just be slow.

Think closely on what they are talking about (ex. If they say he was fighting a scorpion at the time in crypt 3-1, you can tell there is a bad part of the story there) and listen for mistakes. Push them for answers and don't let them take a breather. If they are lying, they may very well buckle under the pressure. Be consistent and persistent. If all else fails, since there is not enough incrimination against each other, you'll have to dismiss the case (as it often ends up) and make a report about it. This may be a tough choice, but justice is blind without evidence to be seen.

### The Art of Investigating

Some crimes are not going to be open and shut in a few seconds. When evidence lacks and witnesses are nowhere to be found, you are the one who has to find them. The main crime that will take investigation is murder, so we will use it as an example. First off, find a guard captain or anyone to assist, doing this solo can be difficult. Next, go to the location of the crime and look for the victims and make sure you get their names. Then look for witnesses, asking if anyone saw anything that may have pertained to murder like healing monsters, Sgrios summons and such. Try to get the name of the accused from the witnesses. Get memories also if there are any.

Once you have all known witness, victim and accused names, ask the victims if they wish to press charges. If so, state that in your report. Make a formal report using the proper report format and send it to both the justice case board (Mileth) and to a local judge. If a judge is not available, a guard captain. Make sure you have done enough investigating so all the judge/Guard Captain has to do it set up a trial and get the people to that trial. Make sure you get all names including accused witness names. Also mail your memories to the judge.

Make sure if you are new to guard that you get a veteran guard to assist you, or if you are a veteran yourself, get any guard who can follow commands. Splitting up to get names and such will help and reporting findings to each other will also speed this up. Time is of the essence in an investigation. Only after the investigation is concluded, and the report sent to the judge can punishment be dealt.

## Other Issues: Friends and the Law

This situation all goes back to the bias issue. Here is a common rule for guard, everyone is innocent until proven guilty and Justice does not care if it is your friend or enemy in a dispute. When a friend gets into trouble, like he starts to speak heretically, warn him. If he continues, warn him again. Eventually, banish him. If he's a friend he'll understand that guard comes first, friends come later. Also, if a friend complains to you about a case and you immediately banish the accused because it is your friend complaining you are showing bad guardsmanship right there and is subject for removal and punishment for abuse of power. If your friend wants you to be unbanished because another guard banished him, take into regard the Persistence of Law (Mileth) and you will not bear your tabard for long if you un-banish him. Always look at things as a guard, not as a friend.

### Higher Authorities

Now what do you do if you are ordered by a higher rank in office to punish someone? Simple, get the info. If this person is a guard or in the law enforcement business s/he can do it his/herself without you. There must be a reason for asking you. Look into the situation briefly and make a snap judgment. Then make a report about the punishment declaring that the higher authority person did indeed tell you to do so. If this was punishment for a corrupt reason manipulated by the higher official, it will show so in the report once investigated and that official may not be in office for much longer. If you have a problem with higher authorities, go to an even higher one for help. If a Guard you are having trouble with. Go to a Guard Captain. Guard Captain, go to a judge. Judge, go to the burgess or mundanes. There is always a solution to problems with Aislings, it is your job as a guard to find them.

### Intimidation

As a guard, you will see Aislings try to intimidate you into submission to avoid punishment or other hindering effects to them. Don't give into threats. It is against the law to intimidate someone in this way and will add on to whatever punishment they may be getting dealt. If they threaten to remove you and do so, simply write the mundanes stating you were removed for doing your job. You will be reinstated in office and the "removers" will have to deal with the mundanes, not a pretty picture `write them at aisling at darkages.com`. Any intimidation after that will either cease or be dealt with further until that Aisling's ability to enter Temuair will not be existent.

If you need to deal with this intimidation/threat, ask a higher official for assistance before the mundanes. Mundanes only do their job when all other procedures have failed. The mundanes are here to help, not pamper, but that doesn't mean they stay away. Try to get things solved with officials, after that write the mundanes. You didn't become a guard to be threatened for doing your job, don't accept it when it happens, fight it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: If someone from Mileth commits a crime in Rucesion or vice versa, who has the authority?  
A: Some Rucesion laws protect all Rucesion citizens anywhere. Mileth citizens are expected to obey their laws and especially Rucesion laws while they are there. Read the jurisdiction law for the best answer to this dilemma.

A: Read the current jurisdiction law.

Q: How can I find out about any questions not answered here?

## My Personal Experience

Well, I have been a guard for 4 terms and am going to soon be a guard captain. Thus far in my guard life I have encountered many things. Heretical, harassing trouble makers seek me out day in and day out trying to get a rise out of me only to be shown up and eventually banished. Higher insight Aislings try to make me lose my temper and outwit me in the laws, only to be outwitted themselves on laws they probably haven't even heard of.

Such is the way a veteran guard who does his job may operate. Soon the tough cases will be daily and the harassment will increase. You will not pay so much attention to the troublemakers and keep your cool around them. The higher insight Aislings will soon discover that you know the laws better than they do and leave you alone. As time progresses, your name will get well known and more Aislings will be asking you for help than other guards.

Also, you'll better realize that this job is more important than you first comprehended and because you enforce it with no remorse, you will be threatened with removals and such. Eventually you will rise to Guard Captain and maybe even Judge, securing your place as one of the greater guardians of Temuair and its people...
