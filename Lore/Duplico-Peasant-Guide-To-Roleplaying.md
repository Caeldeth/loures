# The Peasant's Guide to Roleplaying

_by Duplico in_ ___Dark Ages___

This manual is intended to be a basic introduction to roleplaying, containing suggestions from me from observations I've made on how to make your character Come Alive For you.  I suggest you view this full screen, in 800x600 mode, or, preferably, both. This book is titled "Peasant's," only to provide a tie to my previous piece, in an attempt to begin a series. This is suitable for anyone, not just Peasants, who wishes to obtain a greater background in roleplaying!

It is separated into five nonlinear sections, designed to be read in any order. The individual pieces contained here are as follows:

+ "Who are you?" - a simple questionnaire in an attempt to show you who your character is. and provide a small background. I suggest you read this first.

+ The World - This piece includes ways I suggest to tie your character into the fantasy world of Temuair. These kinds of things are most notable; includes several law citations and "don’ts”. It is second in importance only to the things you learn on your own from "Who are you?"

+ Using the Old Tongue - This gives advanced suggestions into using Gaelic, the Old Tongue, to make your character's speech more authentic. This also gives suggestions in the use of accents.

+ Phrasebook - This is intended as an appendix for reference, not reading like the others. It gives you roleplay phrases to mean out of character ideas, to help you avoid the use of the double parenthesis.

## Who Are You?
This section is designed as a "Draw your own Conclusions" questionnaire. Posed are questions about your character's attitude, political alignment, and so on, that should help you find a good point to roleplay from. (Please note, this assumes your character is a "he." Please take no offense from this.)

1. If your character walks into the pub, will he...  
    a. Feign drunkenness and attack everyone near  
    b. Buy drinks for everyone  
    c. Quietly purchase the cheapest bottle of booze and drink it alone  
    d. Are you kidding? He'd never be in a pub!  

2. If your character walks into a temple during mass, will he...  
    a. Ask loudly, "Hey, what's going on here? Happy hour?"  
    b. Whisper someone, "Eh, be this Mass?"  
    c. Slip away, hoping not to have been noticed  
    d. Join in the audience of the mass and adhere strictly to the Priest  

3. Someone in another group is dying, but they have no red potions. Do you...  
    a. Laugh and heal him at the last possible minute  
    b. Assist quickly and ask, "Be ye injured?"  
    c. Continue hunting. It's not your business. Besides, you have no reds!  
    d. Help in every possible way  

4. In one word, your character is...  
    a. A Comedian  
    b. Friendly  
    c. Antisocial  
    d. Reverent  

5. Your character aspires to achieve which political station and why?  
    a. A guard so he can play around with banishment  
    b. A demagogue, to best help the community  
    c. A respected citizen, to have a few privileges  
    d. Any position of influence to assist others -or- None. Political figures are corrupt.  

6. In what style is your name and why? (least important)  
    a. Lailaxxcvx, put in laIlaxXcVx, to allow you to work without easy banishment.  
    b. RobertsonV ("Robertson the Fifth), to add a conversation item.  
    c. Stanle, simple, nothing to explain about it.  
    d. Ctlbs ("Pronounced Kay-tee-lab-si", after a great Fae), or Dariolis -- fantasy-related.  

This should help you figure out who you are and what niche you would best fill. If you chose mostly A, you are an A-Type, mostly B, you are B-Type, and so on. This is referred to later on in this book.

## The World

This is intended as the bulk of this manual. Hopefully, you know what you want to be, so let's get down to business.

The most important thing to remember is this: You are your character. You live in Temuair. There is no such thing as a computer. Acting contrary to these three points is the major source of heresy. Heresy is any action, portrait, or speech deemed not to fit within the boundaries of the Temuairan fantasy world. If you commit heresy, you are a heretic. Heresy is not a major crime in Temuair, but committing it detracts from the game's level of fun. Now that we have this established, let's continue. 

Heresy is any real-world date, time, day, or country (there are, of course, more, but these are more common). It should be attempted to speak Temuairan most of the time. Try to learn the Temuairan Calendar (covered later on this page). When you have absolutely no choice but to say something heretic, or out of character, you should use "OOC Brackets", also known as "Heresy bubbles." 

> ((OOC Brackets, or heresy bubbles, look like this. They are double parentheses. Sometimes, Brackets or Braces are used, but this is rare. Try to learn it as parentheses.)) 

Heresy is most recognized in heavy roleplaying areas, such as Temples, Quests, Political gatherings, and College.

### The Temuairan Calendar

Temuairan time, or "Tem Time," is exactly four times faster than real life time (Terran Time), or `((RL Time))`. Years are approximately 45 Terran days, and are called Deochs. The nearest equivalent of a month is a "moon," which occurs every 4.5 Terran days. More commonly used, however, is the term "double moon," which represents one Terran week. Many things are based on a two-moon (Terran weekly) cycle. Temuairan time is rarely used in more detail than the terms "Deoch year" and "double-moon."

### Through the Looking Glass

Most important is to attempt to follow the precedents of this mythic Celtic fantasy. Some people have gone so far as to learn Gaelic ("Old Tongue") phrases to use in conversations. Accents are common, as well. Look at yourself and compare what you see to other players. Do you stand out in a negative way? Do you stand out in a good way? Do you blend in? Does this fit with the profile you made for yourself in "Who are you?"? Your character is constantly evolving whether you mean to affect his evolution or not. The most important thing is to have fun, so your persona should be a person you aspire to be, or wish you could have been! It's a very personal thing. Look into the mirror. Who do you see? Are you who you want? 

Make yourself who you want.

### The Price of Tea in China

Another tip to make your experience more authentic is to make casual observations -- small talk, as you would in the real world. Say things arbitrarily, out of the blue... Many people are spontaneous, especially those who are A, B, or C -types. Depending on your impression of yourself, make up trivial and irrelevant things to make conversation. Conversation is a major key.

## Using the Old Tongue

The Old Tongue is the language of ancient Temuair. It is based closely on Gaelic. Look at your spells. They are named after the Gaelic word for what they do. Another example is Dubhaimid: evil creatures. Dubh means darkness in Gaelic. Dubhaimid means, basically, demon. You will find Gaelic a fascinating language if you examine it closely. But continuing on -- let's not get off track! Old Tongue words should be slipped in whenever possible. Try never to say "fire spell" when you can say "srad," unless, maybe, you're a kind of person who answered "A" or "C" mostly on "Who Are You?". There are several phrases you can use in the Old Tongue that will associate well with the theme. I take all of mine from a Gaelic-English dictionary called the Gramadach Lexicon. Here are a few of my favorites:

+ Dar ny Niaughyn! = "By the heavens!"  
+ Ny Beayntee = The blessed souls  
+ sagart = Priest  
+ Slaynt! = A toast, "To salvation!" or "To health!"  
+ Noorey vie ort! = "Good luck to you!"  
+ Slane lhiat! = "Farewell!"  

In Character: Temuairans ceased speaking the Old Tongue thousands of years ago, but it is still used in proper spell names, even as it is archaic. It's casually spoken sometimes, especially in religious communities. As I have noticed, namely Cail, but this is no precedent.

You will find many Aislings who speak with defined accents. As opposed to "Hello, how are you", they may say " 'Ello, 'ow are you", or in my case, " 'Ello, how do ye be this day?". These are excellent ways to make yourself seem more authentic. You should pick sounds to pronounce differently, and stick to this system. Make use of apostrophes. They are the key to utilizing accents. However, though accents are fun, be wary. I've encountered a few too many people who make "Hello, how are you" become " 'e'o, 'ow ah y'", or something of the like. Avoid things like this at all cost. 

No matter how important or entertaining accents are, remember what I say: "Conversation is the key." If your accent impairs efficient and audible conversation, it is a good idea to change it. Ask a number of people if you think it's questionable, especially if you intend to speak in public. A few 'ellos, and "ye’s” make it more interesting without impairing conversation. Archaic sounding words such as thy, thee, and so on, are effective, if used properly. Thy = Your, Thine = Yours, Thee = You. You'll notice that they correspond to the "Me" forms. My, Mine, My, and so on. That may sound a bit confusing, and it isn't very important, though it's a tad interesting. You may want to reread it, but it is nothing vital.
