# Proper Temuairan Ettiquette

_by Aisley in_ ___Dark Ages___

## Section One: Introduction
It's understood that most people dislike "newbs" ((or "nubs" as I like to call them)) but who says we always have to be so mean to them? We've all been there, whether we want to admit it or not... so we all know how hard it is to start out. Unless of course, you're one of those privileged Aislings who came to be in Temuair because some friends talked you into coming here. 

### Nubs, nubs and more nubs. 

We see them running around everywhere, those newly born Aislings... most of us take cover when a pack of them migrates our way. We know what their questions will be, but instead of blowing them off like they've got the plague, how about we do something strange... let's be polite to them! (Side note: Not all "nubs" are those that are from the most recent Deoch, it takes all kinds.) 

## Section Two: Oh the things they say... 

### Money

The most typical nub is the one that will run up to you and beg for money. His speech is often slurred so the words you hear are often hard to make out, but most times after a few minutes you can translate it for yourself. 

"can u spear sum moniez plz??" Translates to "Can you spare me some coins, please?" Most Aislings have heard this one single question more times than they've assailed, sadly. And most nubs hear the same answer: "No." granted a simple "No" is short and to the point, it often leaves the one asking for coins feeling cruddy about themselves. If you give them a small explanation of why you can't spare them some coins, such as "I'm sorry, I don't have the coins to spare right now." they often leave you alone, and apologize for asking, after saying something along the lines of "That's okay, thanks anyway" or even try to help YOU out with some coins. 

### Guiding

Most Aislings eventually decide that they no longer want to be a peasant, so of course, they have to find someone to guide them into their new path. 

"can u plz guild me 2 b a rouge?!" Translates to "I am seeking to become a Rogue, might you be able to help me along my way by guiding me?" There are many ways to handle this, but often times, most Aislings walk away, pretending they didn't hear, or insult the young Aisling seeking a guide. Once again, if you wish not to guide this young one, simply reply with something along the lines of... "I am too busy for students currently and I do not wish to neglect you, so It'd be best if you found someone else." They shouldn't feel ashamed to have to ask someone to guide them, now should they? 
Leeching

Leeching... also a common. Why work when you can gain insights easily?! Sheesh, if only it were that easy all the time. This is commonly seen with Aislings between 20 and 40. But, there have been several occasions where a very young Aisling has sought a leech. Ahh... they learn how to be lazy at such a young age anymore. 

"can u lech mi plz?" Translates to "Would you mind leeching me a few insights? I pay rather well. ;)" A lot of Aislings refuse to do this because they do not wish to promote the laziness of others. Instead of responding with "omg leeching is for n00bs!" simply say "I'm sorry, I feel you should work for your insights, it makes your life worthwhile. When you become closer to my insight, I would be more than happy to hunt with you." Or if you're feeling rather devilish you can say: "I'm sorry, I'm not a Rogue... but see that nice man over there? *points to rogue* If you go ask him, I'm sure he'd help you!" 

### Pets

Ahh, pet's. An Aisling's best friend most times... yet sometimes, they can be your worst enemy, especially if you are letting them stand near you.

"mam can i have ur pet?" Translates to "Ma'am, excuse me, but may I have your pet please?"  As we all know, our pets are bonded to us so it's physically impossible to allow someone to hold our beloved companions.  Younger Aislings often get mad when we don't allow our pets to be in their care, but, hey, the Mundanes made it that way.  There is still no reason to be rude about it though.  A simple response could be, "I'm sorry young one, but my "Snicker-Doodle" here isn't really the friendly type to Aislings she doesn't know.  It'd be best if I kept her with me for the time being."

"sxuze me sir, kan u buy me a pet?" Translates to "Excuse me, kind Sir, I am sorry to bother you, but if at all possible, could you possibly spare a few coines to me.  I am but a lonely Aisling and I feel a pet would give me the companionship I seek."  It's tempting to call them names for assuming you are rich and or just plain foolish enough to buy them a pet, but let's bite out tongues.  Feed them a line if needed, but don't be mean!  "Ah, I wish I could buy you a pet, but you see young lass, this here Blob was a gift from my recently departed Grandmother. *sobs* I'm but a poor, poor Aisling and "Fi-Fi" here is all I have left of my family!  I need to go cry somewhere, alone.  *walks off and grins*"  Simple eh?  No one's feelings got hurt and your didn't have to explain to them why you couldn't/wouldn't let them have the coins.

"wher do i buy a pet?" Translates to "Could you please tell me where I could purchase a pet?"  Yes, yes, I understand how the urge to tell them something completely off the wall, such as "If you go to Oren and attack one of the Pirates there, you'll get a pet from the Pirate!  Make sure you're ungrouped though, otherwise it won't work.  Good luck!"  can be, but after the young one pays a visit ot Sgrios, he'll just come back and ask again, so why not give 'em the truth?  "Head to Tagor, young one.  Pets can be bought there!  The cost of between 5 million and 25 million coins is quite hefty and you'll also need some sort of item or food in order to obtain the pet of your dreams."

### Marriage

Most Aislings seek a companion, whether it be a pet or another Aisling. Fae bonding and Marriage should be a special thing for both Aislings involved ... but, there's the occasional nub that just *has* to get "gladed" or married as soon as possible. Often times they don't care who the other Aisling is, just as long as it's someone of the opposite sex... or in some cases, the same sex.

"i love u, will u marriy me plz? i haev a nice ring for u" Translates to "Hi, I don't know you, but I think you are the most astoundingly beautiful Aisling I've ever seen! What I'm wondering is... would you marry me? I have a beautiful ring here and I think your left hand would make a nice home for it!" It's tempting to tell them "omg die plz [edited due to filter skip - Ange]n00b!" ((But... that would be filter skipping, and that's BAD! :D )) but you should refrain. Instead respond with something along these lines: "I'm already happily married, sorry. :)", "I'm currently single by choice, I do not wish to be in a relationship, but thank you for taking interest in me." or "Sure! Let's get a Priest! *grins*" After the ceremony, you can spring a doozey like this on 'em "Oh, by the way, now that we're married, I expect you to give me half of your coins... oh yeah and I want first pick of all the good items you get. I expect you to bring home all the money while I ... sit and talk to my friends all day. Oh yes, I want 30 children, so we should get started on that soon as well! *dances happily*" 

### Armor

Another thing that is often asked for is Armor. Most armors are easily acquired, but there are some armors that only the Aisling who earned them can wear. They can't be dropped, exchanged or deposited in the bank. You couldn't let anyone else wear them if you wanted to.
 
"whao omg dat armer iz so kool! kan i waer it plz?" Translates to "Wow, your armor looks very nice! Would it be possible for me to try it on?" Most popular answer would probably be, "omg u n00b, this is master armor Amusing u cant wear it! go away." A much nicer answer would be, "I'm sorry, you see, I am a master, and this armor was crafted and fitted so that only I could wear it. When you master you'll get special armor too. :)" Same goes for any other armor that you must carry with you, such as "Penta" armor.

### ((Registration))

((And then of course there are the nubs that run around asking everyone and their cousins to register their accounts. Most people could care less about a nub, let alone give them the money for an account coupon. Oh, and of course the ones that ask you to add them to your account. 

-(Which is a big no-no)- 

"scuze me plz, can u register me plz? I rely liek this gaem! my mom n dad wont giev me da monie 4 it tho. :(" Translates to "For some reason, my parents don't think this game is worth $10 a month. ((They should be shot... who in their right mind would think such a thing!?)) Could you possibly buy me a coupon, I will somehow pay you back, I promise." You could agree to buy the coupon, or tell them no, but as always, be polite about either answer you choose. "Yeah, sure, I'll buy your coupon. Don't worry about paying me back, just... give me your first born. =P" or "No, I'm sorry, I don't have the extra money this month. I just paid up all twelve of my accounts and I'm pretty broke." 

"can u add me 2 ur account plz?!?!?" Translates to "Would you mind having your account blocked just so I can play for free?" There's really no giving a yes to this one, unless you want to risk losing your account... but again, be nice about it. "I can't add you to my account. There are several reasons for this; one being if I did that, you couldn't play while I am on and vice-versa. Also, it's against the rules, if I was caught sharing my account, I could get my account blocked.   :(" )) 

## Section Three: Yay, we made it out alive! 

Indeed we did! If we keep our cool instead of instantly wanting to eat the young ones... and their young... we'll all live a bit happier. Granted, some days there's just no getting around it, you've got to be a tad mean or sarcastic, but hey, it's okay. After a billion (or what seems like it) nubs come running up to you and screaming about the items they want and the money they need, it wears on your nerves. Try to simply take a couple deep breaths and walk away if it's annoying you too much. If they follow you around, screaming about money, turn to them, give them a Suomi Song and tell them that riches can be found in that mystical town, and watch as they disappear into the night. 

((This is supposed to be a semi-comical way of dealing with the everyday stresses that Aislings deal with. It is hoped that some smiles crossed your faces while reading it. Please keep in mind, no nubs were harmed in the making of this lore, these are all trained professionals! ))
