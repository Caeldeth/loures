# Temuair Subpath Guides

## An Introduction to Subpathing

The achievement of the 99th insight is the most critical moment in a Aisling's life. It is at that time, one must decide whether to continue on the same path and Master, or to adventure to a new one. Many feel the question isn't whether to master or Subpath, but what to Sub to. With so many options available, it's difficult to assess which avenue will prove to be not only the most successful, but also the most enjoyable. The most successful Subs are those who choose a path that they themselves will enjoy and that other Aislings will want to hunt with as well. Some Subpaths actually become weaker hunters by abandoning their former class, yet may still thrive because of endless Role-Playing opportunities. This guide is a point-blank approach to all advantages and disadvantages of making a Subpath character. I will not hide aspects of what a class allows because it may not be politically correct. If a character is going to require you a month of training, I will let you know, as well as let you know the best way to go about it.

### Planning Ahead

For the best character development, it is vital that you decide what exactly you would like to make, the moment the character is created. Planning ahead will help you avoid common pitfalls, such as lack of HP/MP to Subpath. In any character development it is important to build your WIS and CON before any stat. Ideally you want to plan to make your 97 armor at 99, so you can Subpath without the delay of an extra 50mil experience to hunt between 98 and 99. Ascension calculators are widely available so you can find the best option for you. Almost every character made will need to ascend some before they can Subpath. As long as your HP/MP levels require less than 40mil in ascending to reach Subpath requirements, you will be able to Sub without extra hunting.

### Requirements

+ Make 97 armor. This is required if you need to ascend to achieve HP/MP requirements. But, even if you have the HP/MP levels to sub, make sure you make the armor. You have lots of free experience, and to make armor in your next path would be wasting experience you could be using to buy stats. You will need to be a Respected Citizen or Tagor Citizen to make this armor.
+ 10 Ard Ioc deums
+ HP/MP levels as outlined for your current class
+ 60 million experience
+ Armor and gear to help you in your next class. (Not required, but a bit silly to Sub naked.)

### To Subpath or not to Subpath

#### Pros

If you enjoy Hunting, Arena, and quests that require strength and endurance, more than likely a Subpath character is going to allow you to compete in these areas far better than a Pure would. There are of course exceptions. For the most part you will be able to obtain all the non-master skills/spells of your current class, plus both the master and non-master skills/spells of your next class. You will be able to advance from 1-99 again in your second class with ease, not to mention with much enjoyment. Personally, I think there is nothing that compares to the fun you can have hunting a sub from 1-80. In most cases, you will have up to an additional 19 stats above your current counterparts and double the skills/spells. If you make a Great Sub, you will be the strongest possible class available and have several advantages over pures and weaker subs, including the ability to hunt 2-man anywhere in the game. More experience/kill will allow for faster Stat maxing and higher HP/MP.

#### Cons

You will have to hunt from 1-99 all over again, while those who choose to Master will be off buying HP/MP/Stats. Any skill/spell leveling you completed previously will be lost, and you will need to level these spells/skills all over again. In short, you will spend countless hours reaching the point to where you can Master. Pure Masters will have better Armor/Gear than you can obtain, and also Skills/Spells that are not available to you. (This is negating Medenian Paths.) In some cases, you will no longer be able to use certain skills/spells or other advantages of your previous class. This is especially true for Rogue and Priest. If you make a Great Sub, you will not be unique, and it will be difficult to stand out amongst your peers. With the introduction of Pure only skills/spells/gear, you may actually become weaker and limited than if you were to have stayed Pure, resulting in a waste of considerable amount of time rebuilding, when you could be Mastered and maxing Stats. By passing over the opportunity to make a Great Subpath, you will actually spend more time looking for a hunt and obtain less experience/hour while hunting. In short, your advancement in the game will be limited as far as Stats, HP, and MP are concerned.

### Subbing Classifications

This is a table I devised from my own experience and opinion. I have divided the Subpaths into categories of Great, Grand, Fine, and Good. These categories are only used to determine how successful your character will be in hunting and arena. Any character can be used for Role Playing and other non-combat/skill challenges, so that will hold no baring. A Sub that is in the Fine category holds relatively the same chance of success as a Pure Path. Those who are in the Good category are weaker than a Pure Path.

|Classification|Combination|
|-|-|
|Great|Wizard/Priest, Warrior/Monk, Monk/Warrior|
|Grand|Priest/Wizard, Monk/Rogue, Priest/Monk, Wizard/Monk|
|Fine|Monk/Wizard, Monk/Priest, Priest/Warrior, Priest/Rogue, Rogue/Monk, Rogue/Warrior, Rogue/Priest, Warrior/Rogue, Wizard/Rogue, Wizard/Warrior|
|Good|Rogue/Wizard, Warrior/Priest, Warrior/Wizard|

### Preparing a Monk to Sub

Subbing requires that you have a lot of Hit Points. Plan on putting all your stats into CON from the very beginning, or you are going to be spending a lot of time on CR30 trying to get the experience to Sub. This could be a real pain, because it will be hard to find a hunt for an Insight 99 Monk Non-Master.

Once you have 15 base CON, put 2 points to DEX, and wear Signet Rings to get Draco Form. (You do not need to make all of your stats 5 base. 5 base DEX is the only Stat requirement for Draco Form. Once you have your Form, return once again to adding CON, until you have CON 65. (Stat plan says 70, but this will give you a few points to play around with to get skills if you don't have full God sets, or want WFF/Howl before you can wear Hyb-Bracers.)

With a Monk, you can play around with your stats by changing Forms. For example, you only need 52 STR, because you can always get Howl/WFF with Kelb Form. You would only need 32 INT and 20 WIS, because when you forget Draco Form, you gain a stat in each one. If you would rather get Mentor in your new class, you only need to get 19 WIS. The best way is to just stick with the stat guide above, so you can get all your skills with Draco Form. Once you forget a Form, you have to wait 3.5 days to learn another. This advice is mainly for those who have messed up their stats and are trying to find a way to get all of their skills/spells.

Get Dion, even if you are Subbing with Draco Form. Hitting Draco Stance and Dion at the same time is going make it so you Dion instantly almost every time.

Because Monks are a much weaker basher compared to Warriors, I would recommend Draco Form over any other form. Your CON will be high, making Draco Tail Kick your most powerful asset. White Bat is a novelty for hide, but does nothing for your bashing power. Kelberoth is only valuable in Arena, and only with HP levels you won't be able to achieve until you master. Scorpion is the weakest Form of all.

Get and max Martial Awareness as soon as possible. This will increase your hunting options, especially with Subs your same insight.

If you are making a Monk/Warrior or Monk/Rogue, be sure and get Claw Fist. It doubles the power of all of your Assails when you Assail with no weapon.

Make your own Hubae. There isn't enough Hubae in the game for you to get all the skills you need, and it's a headache trying to pay for them or get them from people you don't know. Most Monks are going to want around 10 million for you to teach them. I suggest you make friends to help you do Hubae, and be willing to return the favor. Don't worry about getting Wraith Touch (32 Dugons). It is worthless, and only a "for show" skill. It's only useful in Arena Battles, but it is still 5 lines, takes 1400 MP, and misses too often against high MR competitors. Wolf Fang Fist (20 Dugons) is a must for Arena, and also nice for hunting.

If you make your own Hubae, you can also leech your Monk up with mentors. This will really help you out, because if you are adding straight CON, you won't have the stats to get other skills for a while. Just make sure you don't neglect your skills with the mentor leech. You still want to be able to get CR hunts when you are Insight 50.

### Suggested Items to Sub In

Dark Belt, Dark Necklace, Wolf Claws, Peasant Armor, Sparkle Rings or Signets, Silk Boots, Dugon of your choice, and Deoch, Fiosachd, or Gramail Hyb Bracers. Types of Greaves, Earrings, and Shield depends on skills you will try to acquire in your new class. Note: Wearing Cail or Glioca items will not affect the HP/MP you receive at Insights. It is determined by base WIS and CON. Do not take your weapon off. Your Wolf Claws will allow you to basher your way well into your 60s, plus you can still use all of your kicks. Wolf Claws are weaker than a Stone Axe, but they have much better durability, and the ability to use Mantis Kick will help a lot.

### Sub Options: Monk/Warrior

Master Requirements

|Skills|Secrets|Experience|HP|MP|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Maxed Windblade <br> Maxed Wallop|None|200,000,000|4000|2000|

+ Pros: Monk/Warriors are the strongest basher in the game, and arguably the best sub in the game overall. From the moment you Sub, everyone will want to hunt with you. As a Master, everyone will want you to help them out, whether that is in Arena, Hunting, or Grand Master Quests. You have the strongest weapon in the game, the best -AC, and also the best mobility (Ambush and Charge.) I am not the only one to think that Monk/Warrior is also the most fun character to play.

+ Cons: You will not be unique. However, there will always be a shortage for more good Monk/Warriors. The Grand Master Quests have proved that. You will struggle maxing Wind Blade and Wallop to master. You can attest to this by the number of arrest marks Monk/Warriors have racked up. Many avoid this sub for that reason alone. Hubaes and skill training to them are not worth the effort. Plan on speeding at least 30 hours to take Wind Blade from level 70 to level 100 alone.

#### Hints on Monk/Warrior

Your toughest decision will be which Monk Form to Sub with. Because of your 6 assails, you will bash at an incredible rate. Being Draco Form will increase your bashing speed even more. Draco Tail Kick is also a great companion in Chaos, or anywhere else you are surrounded with creatures of the same defensive element. Having both Draco Stance and Dion means that you can Dion instantly almost every time, because you can press both skills simultaneously

However, if you love Arena and plan to get at least 25k HP, Kelberoth is the Form for you. This skill will only be useful in PVP situations. Kelberoth Form will also allow you to become better and better in Arena as you obtain more Hit Points. Also, if you Sub with Kelberoth, plan on spending even more time practicing `((Macroing))`. I suggest setting up an entertainment system next to your computer, so you can keep an eye on yourself. Otherwise, be prepared to get a few ugly legend marks in the process. Not to mention there is a good chance you could die if you leave yourself unattended.

Keep your Wolf Claws on until you are at least Insight 50. Personally, I would keep it on until you can use a 2-handed weapon. Make sure to remove the "~" key from your keyboard to insure you don't accidentally take it off.

Mastering doesn't require many HP or MP. However, I would recommend getting as much Mana as possible. The last thing you want to do is spend experience on Mana while you're trying to max your stats. You will have the advantage of carrying over 19 points when you Sub. At Insight one when you first Sub, put 5 points into WIS and 5 into CON. At Insight two, put another 5 into WIS and 5 into CON, at Insight three start putting all WIS until WIS is at least 30, before you add other stats. If it was my character, I would put WIS to 45. 45 WIS would give you a little over 8k Mana at Insight 99, which will be plenty for you to max stats with and begin to build HP. Even with putting that many stats to WIS, you will still bash at a very good rate.

Your Bracers, Boots, and Signets will allow you to get all of your new skills for a while, so there is no real need to Sub in any God items. The only time you would need to is if you wanted to go all WIS, and needed some Cail items for Assault. However, you are much better off to put 10 points to CON in the beginning. So, because of this, I would recommend subbing in Blessed Gold Earrings and either Blessed or Magic Greaves. Also, be sure that you hunt with Fioschad Beannaich.

Do not take your weapon off to use kicks! Your Assails are going to be much better than your Kicks. If you Sub with Draco Form, you will still be able to use DTK, although your Assail will do more damage.

After you've hit your target WIS mark (between 30-45), take CON to about 20-25. You should still be bashing fast, and now is the best time to squeeze out a few more HP. After you hit your target for CON, start putting all of your stats into STR. You will need to do this so you can finally get out of Peasant Armor, and you'll begin to notice your hunting speed slowing down. Build STR up to about 55 base, before you start to add points to DEX for Beag Suian. This means that if you keep your Bracers and Boots on, you will be able to get Beag Suian between Insight 50 and 60, depending on how much WIS/CON you added.

You will be able to two-man CR the moment you Master. However, this does require an experienced hunter, who can protect their caster, even with minimum HP, slower killing speed, and low Mana. In other words, take a rogue with you unless you know exactly what you're doing.

### Sub Options: Monk/Rogue

Master Requirements

|Skills|Secrets|Experience|HP|MP|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Maxed Peek|Maxed Maiden Trap|200,000,000|4250|2200|

+ Pros: Monk/Rogues are probably the 3rd best basher in the game. Those who love to play Rogues will enjoy this Sub, despite being a weaker hunter. Assassin Strike is also a powerful attack, especially against Dark Defense creatures. You will be able to two man with ease in CR, because you can Blind, Read Elements, plus have the strength to kill. You will also be able to hunt at a really good rate in Chaos, due once again to your number of Assails and Assassin Strike. After time, you will be able to hunt with fewer Great Blinds, which will speed up your hunting rate incredibly. The new Grand Master weapon is rather strong, and with 3 Assails, you will be able to bash at a good rate. You will be a great help on Grand Master quests because you can keep yourself Dioned, plus be able to lead your group through the different mazes.

+ Cons: You won't be the strongest bashing sub, which means you may be overlooked for hunts. You will do well in arena, with your Dion, and even Sleep Snares if you have to outrun your attacker. The ability to avoid traps in Arena will help as well.

#### Hints on Monk/Rogue

Your toughest decision will be which Monk Form to Sub with. If you love Arena, and plan to get at least 25k HP, Kelberoth Form is the way to go. This will make you a weaker hunter. If you were a Monk/Warrior, not having Draco Tail Kick wouldn't make a noticeable difference in hunting speed. However, as a Monk/Rogue, you will be noticeably slower, and really could use the power of DTK while hunting.

Keep your Wolf Claws on as long as possible. You will be able to use all of your kicks, without having to remove your weapon.

You will have the advantage of carrying over 19 points when you Sub. At Insight one when you first Sub, put 5 points into WIS and 5 into CON. At Insight two, put another 5 into WIS and 5 into CON. At Insight three, put 3 into WIS and 2 into CON. For Insights four, five, and six, put 1 to each CON and WIS. Starting at Insight seven, put all WIS until WIS is 45 base, before adding any other Stat. This will give you around 8000 Base Mana at Insight 99. After that, put 5 points into STR, 11 points into DEX, and 7 into INT and get Great Blind. Then continue to build STR. Remember you will need 26 base DEX for Maiden Trap and 22 base INT (if you have an INT Necklace) for Peek.

The only skills you need to bother getting are Great Blind, Study Creature, Maiden Trap, and Peek. Maiden and Peek will only be useful for you because they're required to Master, so it doesn't really matter when you get them. In other words, don't stop adding WIS and CON to get DEX for Maiden Trap. Sub with a few INT items. This will allow you to get Study Creature right away. By the time you're ready for more skills, you should be able to put on a full God set, so there isn't as much of a need to Sub in Luathas leather items. Because of that, I would recommend Subbing in Blessed Coral Earrings and Blessed Leather Greaves or Magic Leather Greaves. Always try to hunt with Fiosachd Beannaich as well.

### Sub Options: Monk/Priest

Master Requirements

|Skills|Secrets|Experience|HP|MP|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|None|Maxed Ard Ioc <br> OR Maxed Ard Naomh Aite|200,000,000|3500|2200|

+ Pros: You will have a unique Sub, especially if you Sub with Wraith Touch. This would mean you would have both Holy and Dark, non-necklace based spells. If you Sub with Kelberoth Form, you could become quite a threat in Arena.

+ Cons: You're a Pure Priest without the Pure Staff, Armor, and Spells. Max STR of 100 and CON of 150 means you'll never redeem much of your Monk attack skills. The only Monk Skills/Spells which could be of any use are Wraith Touch, Beag Nochd, Kelberoth Strike, and Hide. You might have a hard time gaining HP to make Kelberoth Strike worthwhile, because you will need to settle for 3-man hunts, unless you two man with a wizard.

#### Hints on Monk/Priest

When you Sub, make sure to keep your weapon on. Hunt with your Assails in the beginning, instead of a Priest, although, play your stats like a Priest so you can get spells. Around Insight 40 you will need to start acting like a Priest. You might need to before this if you happen to take off your weapon, or you notice you're becoming sluggish with your 3 STR. Once you have some Mana, you can hunt solo with Wraith Touch, although you're still better off in a group.

If you like Arena, Sub with Kelberoth Form. Otherwise, White Bat is probably your best option.

You will have the advantage of carrying over 19 points when you Sub. At Insight one when you first Sub, put 5 points into WIS and 5 into CON. At Insight two, put another 5 into WIS and 5 into CON, at Insight 3 start putting all WIS until WIS is 109 base, before you add other stats. This will insure that you have max Mana regen at Insight 99, plus around 11-12k base Mana.

### Sub Options: Monk/Wizard

Master Requirements

|Skills|Secrets|Experience|HP|MP|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|None|Maxed Two Ard Spells|200,000,000|3750|3600|

+ Pros: You will have a unique Sub. Having Ao Dall and Ao Puinsein as a Wizard can really come in handy. A five second Dion is a major advantage as well. You will be able to 2 man with a good basher, and even be able to heal with Gentle Touch.

+ Cons: I thought this would be a decent sub, until pure Wizards received a 12 second Dion. You've put a lot of work into a Sub, especially if you got 64 Dugons, to have a Pure be better than you are. With so many Wizard/Priests and Priest/Wizards it may be difficult to find a hunt.

#### Hints on Monk/Wizard

When you Sub, make sure to keep your weapon on. You only need to get Mor Fas Nadar and 2 Ard Spells before Insight 99, so you have plenty of room to build Mana. You can also build your STR and be a fairly decent basher, if you can keep your weapon on. You may find that around Insight 50 you will need to become a full Wizard. You might need to before this if you happen to take off your weapon.

If you like Arena, Sub with Kelberoth Form. Otherwise, White Bat is probably your best option.

You will have the advantage of carrying over 19 points when you Sub. At Insight one when you first Sub, put 5 points into WIS and 5 into CON. At Insight two, put another 5 into WIS and 5 into CON, at Insight 3 start putting all WIS until WIS is 109 base, before you add other stats. This will insure that you have max Mana regen at Insight 99, plus around 11-12k base Mana. Ard Puinneag Spiorad, or any of the Ard Leasaich or Ard Nadurs will be very fast to max, and are low Stat requirements. Being said, you could take WIS up to like 120 and try and squeeze every drop of Mana you can.

### Preparing a Priest to Sub

Subbing requires that you have plenty of Hit Points and Mana Points. Most Priests neglect their CON and have to hunt quite a bit extra to make up for it. WIS will be more important, but don't forget to add some CON in the beginning as well. First few insights I would add all to WIS, but around Insight 4, I would begin to add one point to CON and one to WIS each Insight until CON is 20. Then go all WIS until it's a must for you to add INT for spells. Having a Luathas set can really help you out.

Make sure you don't stray from the stat plans. The stat plans are designed with the intentions of using Signets, INT Necklaces, DEX Necklace, Orc Helm, Silk boots, 1H Emerald Sword and full God sets. If you don't have access to these items, you may need to revise the plan.

### Suggested Items to Sub In

Dark Belt, Dark Necklace, Stone Axe/Holy Diana, 97 Tailored/Oren dyed Armor, Sparkle Rings or Signets, and Silk Boots. Type of Gauntlets, Greaves, Earrings, and Shield depends on skills you will try to acquire in your new class. Wearing Cail or Glioca items will not affect the HP/MP you receive at Insights. It is determined by base WIS and CON. Even as a Priest/Sub, Assails could prove to be more valuable to you then subbing with a Holy Diana. The reason for this is you will not have enough Mana to cast any spells for quite a few Insights. If you Sub with a Stone Axe, you can one hit everything in the Crypt, and Insight yourself enough that you can pray without double Insighting. Remember certain Gods will not let you in their temple with a weapon, and you will be too weak to lift a prayer necklace. Make sure you have that all worked out before you Sub. The only time you should think of subbing with a Diana, is if you plan on keeping it on. Ard Cradh/Mor Cradh will be 1 line with it, so it may be something to consider.

### Sub Options: Priest/Wizard

Master Requirements

|Skills|Secrets|Experience|HP|MP|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|None|Maxed Two Ard Spells|200,000,000|3750|3600|

+ Pros: Your biggest comparison will be to Wizard/Priests. Your advantage over them is you have better armor, unlimited Mana, 35 more INT (stronger spells), and you will be able to solo hunt at anywhere from 70 - 150mil exp./hour, plus you will still be a great companion for a basher to hunt with. This is one of the top three subs in the game. You will be able to two-man CR 30 starting at Insight 80, but you probably won't be getting those kind of hunt offers until you Master. This sub is awesome because you don't have to build up any of your stats to be able to 2 man with ease.

+ Cons: No Prahm/Deireas Faileas (unless you have Adorations) or Deo Searg Gar, and 1 line Mor Dion. All these cons really only affect you in Arena. You will be more vulnerable in Arena than a Wizard/Priest.

#### Hints on Priest/Wizard

Mastering requires very few HP/MP, but get as much Mana as you can. You will want to go all out WIS, until Wis is at least 15. Then add 1 point to WIS, 1 point to CON each Insight, until CON is 10 base. Then if you sub in Silk Boots, add 1 point to INT and get Fas Nadar. After that, continue to add only WIS until WIS is 109.You could take WIS up to like 120 and try and squeeze every drop of Mana you can.

Sub in the following: Dark Belt, Dark Necklace, Holy Diana, 97 Tailored/Oren dyed Armor, Sparkle Rings or Signets. Gold Ruby Gauntlets, Luathas Leather Greaves, Luathas Gold Earrings, and Silk Boots or Luathas Enchant Boots.

Those items will get you Fas Nadar. Don't worry about getting Mor Fas until you have 109 Wisdom. At 109 WIS, add the rest of your points for Mor Fas Nadar. This should give you around 12k base Mana at Insight 99.

Keep your Holy Diana on until you master, and you will have 1 line Ard Cradh, 1 line Fas, 2 line Mor Fas, not to mention instant AOs and Mor Dion.

You don't need to get any other Spell to master, because you have Ard Spells from being a Priest. However, Ard Leasaichs and Ard Nadurs level very fast.

### Sub Options: Priest/Monk

Master Requirements

|Skills|Secrets|Experience|HP|MP|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|None|Brown Dugon and Wise Touch <br> OR Maxed Puinneag Beath and Maxed Beag Nochd <br> Or Maxed Claw Fist and Wise Touch|200,000,000|6850 Balanced<br> 8850 Power|4000 Balanced <br>4500 Power|

>Balanced: 15+ base all stats  
>Power: less than 15 in all stats

+ Pros: Priest/Monk is starting to become a popular sub for Arena Lovers. You will be able to Aite yourself, plus Ao Suain, Ao Ard Cradh, etc A three-line Mor or Ard Cradh, plus four line Beag Prahm/Prahm could be a real advantage to you in duels.

+ Cons: You'll be a Pure Monk, without any of the benefits of being Pure. You'll need to hunt 3 man until you get your stats up. (Don't forget those will cost you a little over 10m exp. each.) Once you get your STR/CON up a bit, you'll be able to two man in CR. Your Priest spells will really only be handy in arena, as you will need to hunt with some form of Priest, due to cast lines.

#### Hints on Priest/Monk

Mastering require that you have 7000 or 9000 HP. You could have up to 10 points that you are Subbing with. I would divide your sub points equally between CON and WIS. From then on, go all CON until CON is at least 60, before you add other stats. If you want more Mana, continue to add one point of WIS, starting at about Insight seven, until WIS is between 15-20 base. Make sure you don't neglect your CON. Always try to keep CON at double your Insight or more.

There are two ways you can do this Sub. Either you can Sub with a Holy Diana, and play as a Priest, or you can sub with a Stone Axe and be a basher. Either way you do it, you will still need to play your stats towards WIS and CON, and you will need to keep a very firm grip on your weapon.

You could do really well playing as a Priest. As long as you kept your Holy Diana on, you could play as a Pure Priest until you had the stats to start bashing as a Monk. Keeping your Holy Diana on until you had Max STR/CON would not be a bad idea. You would probably have an easier time finding hunts. If you do this, you'd want to play your WIS up to around 35-45. It's just a really fine line. You need that CON for HP to master.

If you decide to use a Stone Axe, know that Assail will not level with it on. What you want to do is hunt until you are at least 30 before you take off the weapon. Level 50 would be even better, because then you could use wolf claws. Just don't plan to macro your assail until you can remove your weapon. Wear items to help you get Ambush and Double Punch. (Luathas Gold Earrings, Silk Boots, Fiosachd Leather Greaves, and Two Gold Ruby Gauntlets.)

Do not take your weapon off to use kicks! Your Stone Axe is going to be much better than your kicks. You can get Draco Form right away and use Draco Tail Kick. Get Double Punch before you do this, so you don't lose the Dex. You will need to be 4 base Dex for form. All other stats can be 3 base dex. A good time to get Draco form would be when you are about level 11. Then you can relog and your Sparkles will make you 5+ all.

Do not master as a Power Monk. It's not worth it to have to pay that much more for stats. Any slight advantage you have in power with be quickly overturned when other Monks pass you when they can buy more stats than you can.

Make your own Hubae. There isn't enough Hubae in the game for you to get all the skills you need, and it's a headache trying to pay for them or get them from people you don't know. Most Monks are going to want around 10 million for you to teach them. I suggest you make friends to help you do Hubae, and be willing to return the favor. Don't worry about getting Wraith Touch (64 Dugons). It is worthless, and only a "for show" skill. It's only use is in Arena Battles, but it is still 5 lines, takes 1400 MP, and misses too often against high MR competitors. Get it someday, just don't stress out about it. Wolf Fang Fist (40 Dugons) is a must for Arena, and also nice for hunting.

|Maxed Windblade <br> Maxed Wallop|None|200,000,000|4000|2000|

+ Pros: Priest/Warrior could be a fun sub for Arena Lovers. Mor Dion would really be nice for a Warrior, plus being able to Aite yourself, Ao Suian and anything else you might be afflicted with. A three-line Mor or Ard Cradh, plus four-line Beag Prahm/Prahm could be a real advantage to you in duels.

+ Cons: You'll be a Pure Warrior, without any of the benefits of being Pure. Also, you won't be able to read elements, which would make Priest/Monk a better choice. You will have stronger Assails compared to a Priest/Monk, but Priest/Basher is meant for Arena. Where Priest/Monk can become Kelberoth Form, that really makes Priest/Monk a much wiser choice. You'll need to hunt 3-5 man until you get your stats up. After that you could hunt with a Rogue/Wizard, or even just use a Dark Neck in CR.

#### Hints on Priest/Warrior

Mastering doesn't require many HP or MP. However, I would recommend getting as much Mana as possible. The last thing you want to do is spend experience on Mana while you're trying to max your stats. You could have up to 10 points that you are Subbing with. I would divide your sub points equally between CON and WIS. From then on, go all WIS until WIS is at least 45, before you add other stats.

There are two ways you can do this Sub. Either you can Sub with a Holy Diana, and play as a Priest, or you can sub with a Stone Axe and be a basher. Either way you do it, you will still need to play your stats towards WIS, and you will need to keep a very firm grip on your weapon.

You could do really well playing as a Priest. As long as you kept your Holy Diana on, you could play as a Pure Priest until you had the stats to start bashing as a Warrior. Keeping your Holy Diana on until you had Max STR would not be a bad idea. You would probably have an easier time finding hunts.

Be sure to work on your Assails, so you can get Assault, Clobber, Wallop, and Windblade as fast as possible. If you are Subbing with a Holy Diana, you will need to be careful you don't let it break. For this sub you may be better off to sub with a Stone Axe. With all those Assails, you will be pretty strong.

|Maxed Peek|Maxed Maiden Trap|200,000,000|4250|2200|

+ Pros: Once again, this is a sub for someone who loves the Arena. Having the ability to avoid traps, and AO any type of curse thrown at you could be a huge advantage. Mor Dion will also be a huge life saver. A three-line Mor or Ard Cradh, plus four-line Beag Prahm/Prahm could be a real advantage to you in duels.

+ Cons: Your only strong attack will be Assassin Strike. You will be able to read elements, but you won't be strong enough to hunt at the same rate as a Priest/Monk would. You'll have the ability to keep yourself alive in Arena, but you won't really have the power to take out the stronger enemies.

#### Hints on Priest/Rogue

For this sub I would definitely recommend that you Sub with a Holy Diana, and keep it on, unless you just can't stand being a Rogue/Priest any longer. Keeping that Diana on will help you max Maiden Trap faster, plus give you a lot more hunting opportunities. You really won't be strong enough to be bashing CR30 on your own, so it would be wise to keep a Holy Diana on until you know you have the strength to bash 2 man. Assassin Strike will work without a weapon, so I'm sure it will work with your Diana on. Taking that into consideration, you may want to keep your Diana on ...FOREVER. Take the "~" key off your Keyboard, and nuke it.

The only skills you need to bother getting are Great Blind, Study Creature, Maiden Trap, and Peek. Maiden and Peek will only be useful for you because they're required to Master, so it doesn't really matter when you get them. In other words, don't stop adding WIS and CON to get DEX for Maiden Trap. Sub with Luathas Coral Earrings. This will allow you to get Study Creature right away. By the time you're ready for more skills, you should be able to put on a full God set, so there isn't as much of a need to Sub in Luathas leather items.

Mastering doesn't require many HP or MP. However, I would recommend getting as much Mana as possible. The last thing you want to do is spend experience on Mana while you're trying to max your stats. You could have up to 10 points that you are Subbing with. I would divide your sub points equally between CON and WIS. From then on, go all WIS until WIS is at least 45, before you add other stats. After that, put 5 points into STR, 17 points into DEX, and 7 into INT and get Great Blind. Then continue to build STR. Remember you will need 30 base DEX for Maiden Trap and 22 base INT (if you have an INT Necklace) for Peek.

### Preparing a Rogue to Sub

Stat plan above saves you 33 points, which means you have 19 saved, and 14 stats to play around with. The only time you would have to use items for skills is 10 INT for sense and 5 DEX for Maiden Trap. I decided not to suggest putting those stats to the max to get skills, because it's just a waste. It would be a lot better for you to put stats into WIS or CON to get more HP/MP. The great thing about Rogues is you can't screw up your stats.

Subbing requires that you have a fair amount of Hit Points. Plan on putting a fair amount of your stats into CON in the beginning. This should be fairly easy, since the only skills you need are Study Creature, a trap to kill with when you're young, and Great Blind Snare. I would go all CON until CON is 20 or 25. Then take WIS to 10 base, and then add STR so you can get a stronger trap. You should be able to get Stiletto with items before this. Once you have CON to 25 and WIS to around 15, go for Spring Trap, and then Great Blind Snare. You should be fine with HP/MP to sub with. However, once you have Great Blind, I would put more points into WIS, just so you have the extra Mana to blind with in CR.

### Suggested Items to Sub In

Dark Belt, Dark Necklace, Stone Axe, 97 armor, Sparkle Rings or Signets, and Silk Boots. Type of Gauntlets, Greaves, Earrings, and Shield depends on skills you will try to acquire in your new class. Note: Wearing Cail or Glioca items will not affect the HP/MP you receive at Insights. It is determined by base WIS and CON. Do not take your weapon off for any other skill or weapon. Your Assails will be your best friend. I suggest taking the "~" key off of your keyboard.

### Sub Options: /Monk

Master Requirements

|Skills|Secrets|Experience|HP|MP|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|None|Brown Dugon and Wise Touch <br> OR Maxed Puinneag Beatha and Maxed Beag Nochd <br> Or Maxed Claw Fist and Wise Touch|200,000,000|6850 Balanced<br> 8850 Power|4000 Balanced <br>4500 Power|

>Balanced: 15+ base all stats  
>Power: less than 15 in all stats

+ Pros: Rogue/Monks are good to hunt with as non-master Subbers, because they can be both Rogue and strong monk. Two-line Mor Dion can prove to be a a great advantage in Arena. You will also have the nice advantage of retaining Draco Form, until you have enough Hit Points to make Kelberoth worthwhile. (That is if you are an Arena Fiend.) Lowering of HP requirements to 7000 Balanced and 9000 Powered will make it easier to max stats. Monk is very easy to master, if you have the ability to get enough Hubae for your Brown Dugon. You'll never have to worry about needing a Rogue to hunt with.

+ Cons: You're a Pure Monk who can blind, and when you get stronger, blinds will become obsolete in hunting. You won't be able to use many of your Rogue skills, since most of them require you have a Soori equipped. Your bashing rate might be slow enough that you will need to go on 3-5 man hunts for a while. Even with the lowering of Master requirements to 6850 HP, that still means stats are going to be a little over 10,000,000 experience each, and that is if you buy them one at a time. That is almost double that Stat cost for any other class. A Monk/Rogue is a lot more powerful, because they gain an extra assail, have cheaper stats, and they can use all of their monk skills.

#### Hints on Rogue/Monk

Mastering require that you have 7000 or 9000 HP. You will have the advantage of carrying over 19 points when you Sub. At Insight one when you first Sub, put 5 points into WIS and 5 into CON. At Insight two, put another 5 into WIS and 5 into CON, at Insight three start putting all CON until CON is at least 60, before you add other stats. If you want more Mana, continue to add one point of WIS, starting at Insight three, until WIS is between 15-20 base. Make sure you don't neglect your CON. Always try to keep CON at double your Insight or more.

After you Sub, keep your weapon on as long as possible. But know that Assail will not level if you are using a weapon. What you want to do is hunt until you are at least 30 before you take off the weapon. Level 50 would be even better, because then you could use wolf claws. Just don't plan to macro your assails until you can remove your weapon. Wear items to help you get Ambush and Double Punch. (Luathas Gold Earrings, Silk Boots, Fiosachd Leather Greaves, and Two Gold Ruby Gauntlets.)

Do not take your weapon off to use kicks! Your Assails and Stone Axe are going to be much better than your kicks. You can get Draco Form right away and use Draco Tail Kick. Get Double Punch before you do this, so you don't lose the Dex. You will need to be 4 base Dex for form. All other stats can be 3 base dex. A good time to get Draco form would be when you are about level 11. Then you can relog and your Sparkles will make you 5+ all.

Do not master as a Power Monk. It's not worth it to have to pay that much more for stats. Any slight advantage you have in power with be quickly overturned when other Monks pass you when they can buy more stats than you can.

Make your own Hubae. There isn't enough Hubae in the game for you to get all the skills you need, and it's a headache trying to pay for them or get them from people you don't know. Most Monks are going to want around 10 million for you to teach them. I suggest you make friends to help you do Hubae, and be willing to return the favor. Don't worry about getting Wraith Touch (64 Dugons). It is worthless, and only a "for show" skill. It's only use is in Arena Battles, but it is still 5 lines, takes 1400 MP, and misses too often against high MR competitors. Get it someday, just don't stress out about it. Wolf Fang Fist (40 Dugons) is a must for Arena, and also nice for hunting.

### Sub Options: Rogue/Warrior

Master Requirements

|Skills|Secrets|Experience|HP|MP|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Maxed Windblade <br> Maxed Wallop|None|200,000,000|4000|2000|

+ Pros: You'll be able to blind your creatures, and after you master, you will be able to read their elements. That alone is a huge advantage for a Warrior. You will be able to two man in CR, because you can Blind, Read Elements, plus have the strength to kill. You will want to make sure that you have some decent stats, like close to max STR before you two man, or it will probably be a very slow hunt.

+ Cons: Basically, you're a pure Warrior who can blind, since most of your Rogue skills won't work. Until you master, you will need to hunt with a Rogue or a Monk who can read elements. You won't have Asgall or Dion, so you'll be very vulnerable in Arena. No matter how many Hit Points you have, you will always need to Blind when you're hunting. This will slow you down, and you won't be able to hunt at the same rate as other subbed bashers. You will have a tougher time on Grand Master quests, so be sure you have a Priest with you who can Mor Dion Comlha. Also, be sure you max your mends, because your repairs will tend to be higher without Dion.

#### Hints on Rogue/Warrior

Mastering doesn't require many HP or MP. However, I would recommend getting as much as possible. The last thing you want to do is spend experience on Mana while you're trying to max your stats. You will have the advantage of carrying over 19 points when you Sub. At Insight one when you first Sub, put 5 points into WIS and 5 into CON. At Insight two, put another 5 into WIS and 5 into CON, at Insight three start putting half to WIS and half to CON until they're both 20, before you add other stats. If it was my character, I would put WIS 30 or 35, just so you have enough WIS to Blind, and still wear your heavy armor.

Your Boots, and Signets will allow you to get all of your new skills for a while, so there is no real need to Sub in any God items. So, because of this, I would recommend subbing in Blessed Gold Earrings and either Blessed or Magic Greaves. Also, be sure that you hunt with Fiosachd Beannaich.

After you've hit your target WIS mark, start adding STR. If you're still bashing at a good rate, you might want to add a few more points to CON. Build STR up to about 55 base, before you start to add points to DEX for Beag Suain.

### Sub Options: Rogue/Priest

Master Requirements

|Skills|Secrets|Experience|HP|MP|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|None|Maxed Ard Ioc <br> OR Maxed Ard Naomh Aite|200,000,000|3500|2200|

+ Pros: Probably the best sub you can do right now from Rogue. You'll be able to solo up to Insight 50 or more with 2-line Maiden Trap. If you wanted a character to kill macroers with, this would be the one. Ao Dall will make it really nice to solo with. You can even solo Chaos with 1-line Maidens after you get your GM staff. This is also the best character to make if you want to be nice and leech all your friends.

+ Cons: You're a Pure Priest without the Pure Staff and Armor. The advantage to this sub is the ability to solo, but soloing can become very boring. I actually hated hunting this character in groups. Blinding, reading elements, arding, healing, aoing...it can be a pain. The only time it was fun to hunt this character was with a Wiz/Monk, but Mor Fas Nadar is too many lines to make it a fast hunt. If you do hunt, just make sure they can read their own elements. It only took one hunt like that for me to abandon my character.

#### Hints on Rogue/Priest

You will have the advantage of carrying over 19 points when you Sub. At Insight one when you first Sub, put 5 points into WIS and 5 into CON. At Insight two, put another 5 into WIS and 5 into CON, at Insight 3 start putting all WIS until WIS is 109 base, before you add other stats. This will insure that you have max Mana regen at Insight 99, plus around 11-12k base Mana. Once you hit 19 and get that Holy Apollo, you're home free.

### Sub Options: Rogue/Wizard

Master Requirements

|Skills|Secrets|Experience|HP|MP|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|None|Maxed Two Ard Spells|200,000,000|3750|3600|

+ Pros: You will have a 3-line Maiden once you hit Insight 19, and a 1-line maiden when you're a master. You will be able to two man with a good basher. This is actually a good hunting companion for a Monk/Warrior who has Max STR, but doesn't have the HP to hunt without blinds. You can do pretty well in chaos too, because you have Pian Na Dion plus Maidens. It's also nice to be able to read elements, especially since it seems Nexon is moving towards giving Wizards higher elemental spells, and making MSPG obsolete.

+ Cons: This character completely sucks in arena. Best you can do is going in and MSPG and die. You're a Pure Wizard without the Pure Staff, Armor, and Dion. However, you will probably get more hunt offers than they will. In the early 20s, this was a pretty popular sub, but they're being replaced by Priest/Wizards. Your hunting partners will abandon you once they have the HP to hunt without blinds.

#### Hints on Rogue/Wizard

Sub in the following: Dark Belt, Dark Necklace, 97 Tailored/Oren dyed Armor, Sparkle Rings or Signets, Stone Axe, Gold Ruby Gauntlets, Luathas Leather Greaves, Luathas Gold Earrings, Luathas Wood Shield, and Silk Boots.

Those items will get you Fas Nadar. Don't worry about getting Mor Fas until you have over 100 Wisdom. At 100 WIS, add the rest of your points for Mor Fas Nadar. This should give you around 12k base Mana at Insight 99.

Mastering requires very few HP/MP, but get as much Mana as you can. You will want to go all out WIS, until WIS is at least 15. Then add 1 point to WIS, 1 point to CON each Insight, until CON is 10 base. After that, continue to add only WIS until you reach your WIS goal. You could take WIS up to like 120 and try and squeeze every drop of Mana you can. The 10 base CON is for Fas Nadur

Ard Puinneag Spiorad, or any of the Ard Leasaich or Ard Nadurs will be very fast to max, and are low Stat requirements.

### Preparing a Warrior to Sub

Stat plan is for the minimum INT/WIS/DEX to get all skills. If you don't have all of the items, like an emerald sword, stat necks, silk boots, you can move points from STR and CON to the other stats. CON is high because you need 8.4k hp to sub.

Subbing requires that you have a lot of Hit Points. Plan on putting all your stats into CON from the very beginning, or you are going to be spending a lot of time on CR30 trying to get the experience to Sub. I would recommend as a Warrior that you put at least 30-35 points into CON before anything else.

As a Warrior, don't become too worried about getting Beag Suian. After putting that much into CON you are going to need STR. If you don't get Beag Suian until your late 70s, that is fine. If you don't have leech options, make sure you work a lot on your Assails so you can be a decent basher.

### Suggested Items to Sub In

Dark Belt, Dark Necklace, Chain Mace, lightweight Armor (like Insight 41), Sparkle Rings or Signets, and Silk Boots. Type of Gauntlets, Greaves, Earrings, and Shield depends on skills you will try to acquire in your new class. Note: Wearing Cail or Glioca items will not affect the HP/MP you receive at Insights. It is determined by base WIS and CON. Do not take your weapon off for any other skill or weapon. Your Assails will be your best friend. I suggest taking the "~" key off of your keyboard.

### Sub Options: Warrior/Monk

Master Requirements

|Skills|Secrets|Experience|HP|MP|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|None|Brown Dugon and Wise Touch <br> OR Maxed Puinneag Beath and Maxed Beag Nochd <br> Or Maxed Claw Fist and Wise Touch|200,000,000|6850 Balanced<br> 8850 Power|4000 Balanced <br>4500 Power|

>Balanced: 15+ base all stats  
>Power: less than 15 in all stats

+ Pros: Warrior/Monks are the second strongest basher. Two-line Mor Dion can prove to be a a great advantage in Arena. You should be able to solo bash CR30 at a steady pace after you Master, depending on your skill levels. You will definitely be able to handle it by the time you are around 100 STR / 100 CON. You will also have the nice advantage of retaining Draco Form, until you have enough Hit Points to make Kelbroth worthwhile. (That is if you are an Arena Fiend.) Lowering of HP requirements to 7000 Balanced and 9000 Powered will make it easier to max stats. Monk is very easy to master, if you have the ability to get enough Hubae for your Brown Dugon. Also, fixes have been made to the master weapon, but it is still not as strong as it should be. Assails will not level with it equipped. No word on Assails leveling with Grand Master Weapon or not.

+ Cons: Not nearly as strong as a a Monk/Warrior. You will lack Charge, lower AC, and much more powerful Master Weapon. Monk/Warriors will be able to hunt faster, and max stats faster. Only thing that will slow them down is maxing skills for Master. However, this just means they will be stronger than you if you don't do the same. Your bashing rate might be slow enough that you will need to go on 3-5 man hunts for a while. Even with the lowering of Master requirements to 6850 HP, that still means stats are going to be around 10,000,000 experience each, and that is if you buy them one at a time. That is almost double that Stat cost for any other class. Put it this way, very few have had the willpower to "legally" max one of these babies out. Even some of the best Warrior/Monks are not max-all.

#### Hints on Warrior/Monk

Mastering require that you have 7000 or 9000 HP. You will have the advantage of carrying over 19 points when you Sub. At Insight one when you first Sub, put 5 points into WIS and 5 into CON. At Insight two, put another 5 into WIS and 5 into CON, at Insight three start putting all CON until CON is at least 60, before you add other stats. If you want more Mana, continue to add one point of WIS, starting at Insight three, until WIS is between 15-20 base. Make sure you don't neglect your CON. Always try to keep CON at double your Insight or more.

After you Sub, keep your weapon on as long as possible. But know that Assail, Assault, and Long Strike will not level if you are using a weapon. What you want to do is hunt until you are at least 30 before you take off the weapon. Level 50 would be even better, because then you could use wolf claws. Just don't plan to macro your assails until you can remove your weapon. Wear items to help you get Ambush and Double Punch. (Luathas Gold Earrings, Silk Boots, Fioschad Leather Greaves, and Two Gold Ruby Gauntlets.)

Do not take your weapon off to use kicks! Your Assails and Chain Mace are going to be much better than your kicks. You can get Draco Form right away and use Draco Tail Kick. Get Double Punch before you do this, so you don't lose the Dex. You will need to be 4 base Dex for form. All other stats can be 3 base dex. A good time to get Draco form would be when you are about level 11. Then you can relog and your Sparkles will make you 5+ all.

Do not master as a Power Monk. It's not worth it to have to pay that much more for stats. Any slight advantage you have in power with be quickly overturned when other Monks pass you when they can buy more stats than you can.

Make your own Hubae. There isn't enough Hubae in the game for you to get all the skills you need, and it's a headache trying to pay for them or get them from people you don't know. Most Monks are going to want around 10 million for you to teach them. I suggest you make friends to help you do Hubae, and be willing to return the favor. Don't worry about getting Wraith Touch (64 Dugons). It is worthless, and only a "for show" skill. It's only use is in Arena Battles, but it is still 5 lines, takes 1400 MP, and misses too often against high MR competitors. Get it someday, just don't stress out about it. Wolf Fang Fist (40 Dugons) is a must for Arena, and also nice for hunting.

### Sub Options: Warrior/Rogue

Master Requirements

|Skills|Secrets|Experience|HP|MP|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Maxed Peek|Maxed Maiden Trap|200,000,000|4250|2200|

+ Pros: Warrior/Rogues have a very Strong Assail. With 215 DEX, 180 STR, and 5 Assails, they're very close to matching a Monk/Warrior when it comes to Assail damage. They are very strong bashers. If they had a weapon equal to a Warrior's, and one more Assail, their Assails would be the best in the game. Assassin Strike is also a powerful attack, especially against Dark Defense creatures. You will be able to two man with ease in CR, because you can Blind, Read Elements, plus have the strength to kill. You will want to make sure that you have some decent stats, like close to max STR before you two man, or it will probably be a very slow hunt. You will also be able to hunt at a really good rate in Chaos, due once again to your number of Assails and Assassin Strike.

+ Cons: You will be missing a Dion. That really is the only bad part about this Sub, but it is a major one. No matter how many Hit Points you have, you will always need to Blind when you're hunting. This will slow you down, and you won't be able to hunt at the same rate as say a Monk/Warrior, Warrior/Monk, or even a Monk/Rogue will. No Dion also means that you better hate the Arena, because you will be extremely easy to kill. You will have a tougher time on Grand Master quests, so be sure you have a Priest with you who can Mor Dion Comla. Also, be sure you max your mends, because your repairs will tend to be higher without Dion.

#### Hints on Warrior/Rogue

When you Sub, make sure to keep your weapon on. You will be hunting as a Warrior. The only skills you need to bother getting are Great Blind, Study Creature, Maiden Trap, and Peek. Maiden and Peek will only be useful for you because they're required to Master, so it doesn't really matter when you get them. In other words, don't stop adding WIS and CON to get DEX for Maiden Trap. Sub with INT items, such as Luathas Coral Earrings. This will allow you to get Study Creature right away. By the time you're ready for more skills, you should be able to put on a full God set, so there isn't as much of a need to Sub in Luathas leather items. Because of that, I would recommend Subbing in Blessed Coral Earrings, Blessed Leather Greaves, and Two Gold Emerald or Heartstone Gauntlets. Always try to hunt with Fiosachd Beannaich as well.

You will have the advantage of carrying over 19 points when you Sub. At Insight one when you first Sub, put 5 points into WIS and 5 into CON. At Insight two, put another 5 into WIS and 5 into CON. At Insight three, put 3 into WIS and 2 into CON. For Insights four, five, and six, put 1 to each CON and WIS. Starting at Insight seven, put all WIS until WIS is 45 base, before adding any other Stat. This will give you around 8000 Base Mana at Insight 99. After that, put 5 points into STR, 17 points into DEX, and 7 into INT and get Great Blind. Then continue to build STR. Remember you will need 30 base DEX for Maiden Trap and 22 base INT (if you have an INT Necklace) for Peek.

### Sub Options: Warrior/Priest

|-|-|-|-|-|
|None|Maxed Ard Ioc <br> OR Maxed Ard Naomh Aite|200,000,000|3500|2200|

+ Pros: You will be able to Beag Suian creatures that are coming after you, and you'll be able to Wind Blade creatures to get them off of someone else. You will be able to have a very unique Sub, shared only with Zepher that I know of, which could make some good possibilities for Role Playing.

+ Cons: You're a Pure Priest without the Pure Staff and Armor. Max STR and DEX of 100 means you'll never redeem much of your Warrior skills. Your best weapon is a Stone Axe, which is like using a Stick compared to the Grand Master Warrior weapons. Be prepared to have everyone wondering why you made such an "unusual" Sub. A Pure Priest will be better than you, because they will have instant Ard Cradh. This is a type of Sub where Pure Masters will get more hunt offers than you will.

#### Hints on Warrior/Priest

When you Sub, make sure to keep your weapon on. Hunt more as a Warrior in the beginning, instead of a Priest, although, play your stats like a Priest so you can get spells. Around Insight 40 you will need to start acting like a Priest. You might need to before this if you happen to take off your weapon, or you notice you're becoming sluggish with your 3 STR.

You will have the advantage of carrying over 19 points when you Sub. At Insight one when you first Sub, put 5 points into WIS and 5 into CON. At Insight two, put another 5 into WIS and 5 into CON, at Insight 3 start putting all WIS until WIS is 109 base, before you add other stats. This will insure that you have max Mana regen at Insight 99, plus around 11-12k base Mana.

Your best weapon is a Stone Axe, which is like using a Stick compared to the Grand Master Warrior weapons. Be prepared to have everyone wondering why you made such an "unusual" Sub. A Pure Wizard will be better than you, because they will have Dion and instant spells. This is a type of Sub where Pure Masters will get more hunt offers than you will.

#### Hints on Warrior/Wizard

When you Sub, make sure to keep your weapon on. Hunt more as a Warrior in the beginning, instead of a Wizard. You only need to get Mor Fas Nadar and 2 Ard Spells before Insight 99, so you have plenty of room to build Mana. You can also build your STR and be a fairly decent basher, if you can keep your weapon on. You may find that around Insight 50 you will need to start acting like a Wizard. You might need to before this if you happen to take off your weapon.

You will have the advantage of carrying over 19 points when you Sub. At Insight one when you first Sub, put 5 points into WIS and 5 into CON. At Insight two, put another 5 into WIS and 5 into CON, at Insight 3 start putting all WIS until WIS is 109 base, before you add other stats. This will insure that you have max Mana regen at Insight 99, plus around 11-12k base Mana. Ard Puinneag Spiorad, or any of the Ard Leasaich or Ard Nadurs will be very fast to max, and are low Stat requirements. Being said, you could take WIS up to like 120 and try and squeeze every drop of Mana you can.

### Preparing a Rogue to Sub

The stat plan above will get you everything you need. MSPG, Ard Creag, Ard Srad, and Ard Athar. You will need full God sets, plus Orc Helm, Signets/Sparkle Rings, INT Necklace, DEX Necklace, 1H Emerald Sword, Silk boots, and Dwarf Helm to be able to get all of those spells. You will only have 1 stat to carry with you to your next Sub. (I.e, don't screw up your Stats.) If you're not Subbing to Priest, you could forget getting the Ards, because I the last thing you are going to use is a 7-line Ard, so don't waste your points. Even if you are going Priest, it's not that crucial that you get all three Ards. You could actually just Sub with 19 points instead. However, the way I look at it, you can always buy more Stats and HP/MP, but you can never have the chance to get those spells again. The other spells you want to Sub with are: 1 Ard Elemental Nadar, Athar Lamh, Sal Lamh, Mor Strioch Bais, Ard Puinneag Spiorad, Mor Fas Nadar, Beag Fas Nadar, and Dachaidh. For any other class, except those going to Priest, sub with all the Lamhs, and anything else you want. For Priests, anything else and you'll probably need to forget it at one point for more Priest spells.

Subbing requires that you have a fair amount of both Hit Points and Mana Points. Concentrate on building only WIS and CON from the very beginning. The only spell you will need is Mor Fas Nadar, so get your WIS and CON first. This means you will be able to make your armor at 99, and sub without any extra delays, like hunting off 50mil from Insight 98 to 99.

No matter what you Sub to, I would recommend you Sub in a Stone Axe. Wizard Staffs are crap, and you will be much better off to 1 Hit your way up, until you have enough Mana you could hunt with Lahms and MSPG. Remember some Gods will not let you in their temple with a weapon, and you won't have the STR to pick up a Prayer Necklace.

### Suggested Items to Sub In

Dark Belt, Dark Necklace, Stone Axe/Holy Diana, 97 Tailored/Oren dyed Armor, Sparkle Rings or Signets, Silk Boots. Type of Gauntlets, Greaves, Earrings, and Shield depends on skills you will try to acquire in your new class. Wearing Cail or Glioca items will not affect the HP/MP you receive at Insights. It is determined by base WIS and CON.

### Sub Options: Wizard/Priest

Master Requirements

|Skills|Secrets|Experience|HP|MP|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|None|Maxed Ard Ioc <br> OR Maxed Ard Naomh Aite|200,000,000|3500|2200|

+ Pros: Wizard/Priests are one of the best Subs in the game. You won't have any problem finding hunts, and you will be awesome in Arena. Your biggest comparison will be to Priest/Wizards. Your advantage over them is you will be able to get all of the Priest spells without Adorations. You will also have Deo Searg Gar, and 0-line Mor Dion. You will be able to two-man CR 30 starting at Insight 80, but you probably won't be getting those kind of hunt offers until you Master, or at least have Ard Cradh. This sub is awesome because you don't have to build up any of your stats to be able to 2 man with ease.

+ Cons: You will not be unique. In addition, you will never be able to Solo, and least not at the rate a Priest/Wizard can. You will have less INT than a Priest/Wizard, and weaker armor. Not to mention you will have limited Mana, which is the only reason you will need to hunt with a good basher.

#### Hints on Wizard/Priest

n addition to the above, Sub in all Luathas items: Gold Ruby Gauntlets, Luathas Leather Greaves, Luathas Coral Earrings, Luathas Enchanted Boots, and a Luathas Wooden Shield. Don't worry about putting Stats into INT to get spells. Your Luathas items will get you the few spells that you'll need. If you start worrying about getting spells at Insight 10, you're going to mess up your potential Mana. You can Sub in Silk Boots, but that means you will be one INT short of IOC.

When you Sub, go all WIS until WIS is 109. Scary, yes, I know. You'll be happy at Insight 99 when you have 12k Mana. Some may suggest adding a few points to CON, but I believe you're much better off with Mana. It costs twice as much when you're a Master, and it's not like you need any HP to Master.

Your base stats will be: 8 - 13 - 5 - 5- 11. (Yes, Cean STR Spell included.) With those stats you can get: Beag Ioc, Armachd, Ao Beag Cradh, Beannaich, Fas Deiras, Ao Puinsein, Beag Cradh, Ioc, and possibly Mor Beannaich. You can get Ao Dall if you add one point to CON. That's it until you're Insight 54. (There are some Seun's and Slans in there you could get, but why bother. Your Spell Book is full enough already.) I know, it's a big price to pay for Mana, but you were a good Wizard, right?

Here is the tricky part. You need to get 8 Insights. Then, get Beag Ioc and level it, before you log off and before you take off your Luathas shield. Why? Because if you relog, you will have 0 Mana with all those leather items. If you take off that shield, you will only have 12 INT and you need 13 for Ioc. Once you have Beag Ioc to 30, you can log off. When you come back, your Mana will be at 0, and you will have the stats to go get Ioc, along with your other spells. Once you have Ioc, you can take off your Shield. If you have enough Mana, you can get Beannaich to level 30, and go for Mor Beannaich. You should still be able to Insight yourself with a Stone Axe, so it maybe in your best interested to keep on the Luathas Greaves, until you have some Mana with which to get Mor Beannaich with. Or, go ahead and take them off too, and get Mor Beannaich when you are able to put them on again. (Which would be around Insight 19 when you switch to Priest Staffs.)

### Sub Options: Wizard/Rogue

Master Requirements

|Skills|Secrets|Experience|HP|MP|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Maxed Peek|Maxed Maiden Trap|200,000,000|4250|2200|

+ Pros: A very unique Sub, and I myself only know of one person who has done it. It's actually not too bad from 1-80, but after Insight 80, other Aislings are looking for someone who can cast Mor Fas a little bit faster than 4 lines. The drop in lines does help out a lot. There could be some possibilities for soloing CR after you build your Stats, but more than likely, your only advantage will be you won't have to ask for Fas when you go to the Arena.

+ Cons: You won't be the strongest bashing sub, which means you may be over-looked for hunts. Your only strong attack will be Assassin Strike. Basically, you're a Pure Rogue without the benefits.

#### Hints on Wizard/Rogue

The only skills you need to bother getting are Great Blind, Study Creature, Maiden Trap, and Peek. Maiden and Peek will only be useful for you because they're required to Master, so it doesn't really matter when you get them. In other words, don't stop adding WIS and CON to get DEX for Maiden Trap. Sub with INT items, such as Luathas Coral Earrings. This will allow you to get Study Creature right away. By the time you're ready for more skills, you should be able to put on a full God set, so there isn't as much of a need to Sub in Luathas leather items.

Mastering doesn't require many HP or MP. However, I would recommend getting as much Mana as possible. The last thing you want to do is spend experience on Mana while you're trying to max your stats. You could have up to 10 points that you are Subbing with. I would divide your sub points equally between CON and WIS. From then on, go all WIS until WIS is at least 45, before you add other stats. After that, put 5 points into STR, 17 points into DEX, and 7 into INT and get Great Blind. Then continue to build STR. Remember you will need 30 base DEX for Maiden Trap and 22 base INT (if you have an INT Necklace) for Peek.

### Sub Options: Wizard/Warrior

Master Requirements

|Skills|Secrets|Experience|HP|MP|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Maxed Windblade <br> Maxed Wallop|None|200,000,000|4000|2000|

+ Pros: You will have a unique Sub, and, well that's about it. You can hunt in a group and be the Fasser, but once you hit higher Insights, groups will expect Fas to be 1 line. I'm sure there are some ways you could have fun Role Playing a sub like this.

+ Cons: There really isn't the potential to Solo Hunt at higher Insights with a Sub like this, because you can't hide, you can't Dion, and you can't read elements. You're a Pure Warrior without Asgall, so even if you do go to the Arena, you'll probably die before you can Fas yourself. It would be better to make a Pure Warrior and find a friend who is a Wizard to tag along with.

#### Hints on Wizard/Warrior

When you Sub, make sure to keep your weapon on. You will actually make a really good basher up until you are Insight 80. You'll have an extra 19 points to put towards STR, plus your Stone Axe will help out a lot.

You will have the advantage of carrying over 19 points when you Sub. At Insight one when you first Sub, put 5 points into WIS and 5 into CON. At Insight two, put another 5 into WIS and 5 into CON, at Insight 3 start putting one point to WIS and one to CON until they are both are 20. It doesn't take a lot of Mana to cast Fas, so you're better off going for STR at that point.

### Sub Options: /Monk

Master Requirements

|Skills|Secrets|Experience|HP|MP|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|None|Brown Dugon and Wise Touch <br> OR Maxed Puinneag Beath and Maxed Beag Nochd <br> Or Maxed Claw Fist and Wise Touch|200,000,000|6850<br> 8850<br>|4000 Balanced <br>4500 Power|

>Balanced: 15+ base all stats  
>Power: less than 15 in all stats

+ Pros: The only Basher who can truly solo. A few have made this Sub, but the only ones who do well with it have cheated their Fas lines. Like stated above, you may see DA Team drop the Mor Fas lines down a notch, but don't make this sub hoping that will happen. If you wanted a Wizard/Basher, this is by far the best Sub Choice.

Well it happened finally. Mor Fas is 4 lines, making this pretty good sub to consider. A 4-line Mor Fas isn't that bad. You might actually see more of these subs popping up.

+ Cons: You will be a Pure Monk, yet you won't have the better armor and extra skills. Your stats will be costly, but if you're dedicated, that won't hold you back. You won't be the strongest basher, but you'll be able to hold your own.

#### Hints on Wizard/Monk

	
Mastering require that you have 7000 or 9000 HP. You will have the advantage of carrying over 19 points when you Sub. At Insight one when you first Sub, put 5 points into WIS and 5 into CON. At Insight two, put another 5 into WIS and 5 into CON, at Insight three start putting all CON until CON is at least 60, before you add other stats. If you want more Mana, continue to add one point of WIS, starting at Insight three, until WIS is between 15-20 base. Make sure you don't neglect your CON. Always try to keep CON at double your Insight or more.

If you decide to use a Stone Axe, know that Assail will not level with it on. What you want to do is hunt until you are at least 30 before you take off the weapon. Level 50 would be even better, because then you could use wolf claws. Just don't plan to macro your assail until you can remove your weapon. Wear items to help you get Ambush and Double Punch. (Luathas Gold Earrings, Silk Boots, Fiosachd Leather Greaves, and Two Gold Ruby Gauntlets.)

Do not take your weapon off to use kicks! Your Stone Axe is going to be much better than your kicks. You can get Draco Form right away and use Draco Tail Kick. Get Double Punch before you do this, so you don't lose the Dex. You will need to be 4 base Dex for form. All other stats can be 3 base dex. A good time to get Draco form would be when you are about level 11. Then you can relog and your Sparkles will make you 5+ all.

Get your CON up high. Do not master as a Power Monk. It's not worth it to have to pay that much more for stats. Any slight advantage you have in power with be quickly overturned when other Monks pass you when they can buy more stats than you can.

Make your own Hubae. There isn't enough Hubae in the game for you to get all the skills you need, and it's a headache trying to pay for them or get them from people you don't know. Most Monks are going to want around 10 million for you to teach them. I suggest you make friends to help you do Hubae, and be willing to return the favor. Don't worry about getting Wraith Touch (64 Dugons). It is worthless, and only a "for show" skill. It's only use is in Arena Battles, but it is still 5 lines, takes 1400 MP, and misses too often against high MR competitors. Get it someday, just don't stress out about it. Wolf Fang Fist (40 Dugons) is a must for Arena, and also nice for hunting.
