#  The Complete Guide to Fishing: Facts, Food, Fashion & Fun

_by Elenoir in_ ___Dark Ages___

## Introduction	
Fishing is one of Temuair's greatest pastimes. Not only can it be fun, but it can also suffice as a source of income. Throughout Temuair, Aislings are picking up poles and giving this age-old sport a try. Whether you're a warrior, wizard, monk, priest, rogue, or peasant, fishing can cure your boredom, add to your closet, and fill your bellies as well as your pockets.	
First Thing's First	

So, you've decided to give it a go? Great! The first thing any Aisling needs to do to get started is to visit ol' Kamel, the fish monger, at his shop in Abel. Kamel's shop is located in the southern area of town somewhat close to the harbor.

Upon speaking with Kamel, you should inquire about any jobs he might have for you. If you're at all interested, you're given the opportunity to work for him by catching bucket-loads of fish and bringing them back to the shop. Should you accept, Kamel suggests that you invest in a sturdy fishing rod and purchase a bit of bait.	
		
For 50,000 gold coins, you may buy a durable wooden fishing rod, crafted by Kamel himself.	
		
Fishing bait is sold for 200 gold coins per piece and can be bought in bulk (you may carry up to 100 pieces of bait). It is Kamel's own special blend of spore, worm, and animal bits that seems to successfully attract the fish.	
		
## Location, Location, Location	

Now that you've got your fishing equipment, it's time to search for that perfect spot! The best spots are usually quiet and out of the way, as fish in busy areas like Mileth and Rucesion never seem to get close to the surface (which is why you never see them!). I usually prefer venturing as far Suomi, since the water there is cool and clear and there are never many people bustling about. Other locations include Undine, Abel Harbor, Loures Harbor, Piet, and outside of Kasmanium Mines. Below are pros and cons of each site.	

### Undine

+ Pro: Lots of watery areas due to the large river running through the village and it's more of a remote location.  
+ Con: Because the area is so vast and the river is wide, it requires a lot of walking around to discover decent fishing spots.

### Abel Harbor

+ Pro: The Harbor is long so there is plenty of room for many Aislings to share the water.  
+ Con: Unfortunately, the ships coming in about out of the Harbor make if difficult to spot the fish and disturb the water too often.

### Loures Harbor

+ Pro: Large Harbor with plenty of fishing space, not many people occupy this location.  
+ Con: As with Abel Harbor, Loures Harbor also has many ships traveling in and out of port. High cliffs that surround the Harbor make it a little more difficult to see the fish well or get closer to them.

### Piet

+ Pro: Less of a busy area. The small waterway that winds through the village makes for some certain spots that have a cluster of fish.  
+ Con: Sometimes your line can get tangled in the trees and bushes that surround the length of the creek.

### Kasmanium Mines

+ Pro: The deep waters of the mines make for prime fishing holes. The water is cool and the area is shady.  
+ Con: The giant pools of the mine stretch back a little far, so most Aislings may have trouble casting their line all the way out, leaving some fish behind.

### Suomi

+ Pro: Far, far away from the pitter-patter of many feet. Clean, clear water and the small creek force fish to gather in certain areas.  
+ Con: Honestly, I have nothing bad to say about Suomi, except that it's an awful long walk from Kamel's place..	
		
## A Fishy Variety	

I'm sure all of you new to fishing are probably wondering what types of fish there are swimming around in the water. Well, here in Temuair, we have five types of fish. Not many, I know, but we take what we can get! Below are pictures of our finned friends, as well as short descriptions and how much each will fetch you in the market.

+ Trout: The most common fish and the most frequently caught. Their orange scales make them easy to spot from the surface. These sell for 1,000 gold coins.

+ Bass: Bass are the second most common type. They have soft, blue and orange scales and are larger than trout. These will sell for 2,000 gold coins.

+ Rock Fish: These little guys have tough scales. Also, being multi-toned (which allows them to blend with pebbles and mud), they are a little more difficult to spot below the water. You'll be able to sell these for 3,000 gold coins.

+ Lion Fish: Lion Fish, also known as Blowfish, are not as easy to catch or spot as the rest. They are darker in color and do well to camouflage themselves among roots, weeds, and mud. They have small spines on the outside of their body to protect their soft bellies. These fish will earn you 4,000 gold coins each.

+ Purple Whopper: This is the most elusive fish of all. In fact, Kamel himself has only just caught a glimpse of it. Upon hooking it, he explains that it snapped his line and got away. So far, there have been no other sightings. It's unknown how much this fish will sell for or what the reward is for catching it.

You should also be aware that fish aren't the only things caught in Temuair. Junk is sometimes discarded into the waters by passing Aislings, as well as peasant children losing belonging in the water after a relaxing dip. You may also find something special of the unusual sort.

+ Useless Boot: Usually tossed in the water or lost and forgotten by those who have visited the water's edge.

+ Mushroom Cap: A curious catch, indeed. I can only speculate that some creature's diet must consist of the stalk of the spore, leaving just the tops floating around in the water. These can only be salvaged from the Kasmanium Mines and many Aislings enjoy wearing them as hats. Quite a silly fashion statement if you ask me.	
		
## It's All in the Wrist: Techniques and Other Tips	

Each and every Aisling has their own secrets for catching fish. The most skilled fishermen are quite used to the many flicks of the wrist and tugs of the pole and don't tire easily. The rest of us can become exhausted in a short period of time from all of the casting a reeling, and therefore are in much need of some tips and tricks to make fishing less of a chore and restore its enjoyable recreational value.	

+ Make sure you have plenty of bait with you, as fish sometimes tend to swim off with it, leaving you no choice but to reel in your line and rebait. Once you run out, you'll have to walk all the way back to Kamel's shop to purchase more.

+ Find an out of the way spot so you won't be squabbling with others who may "steal" the fish you've got your eyes on.

+ Get as close to the fish as you possibly can. Fish that are too far away are ultimately out of your casting range and you will only frustrate yourself if you aim for them.

+ Cast, reel, cast, reel, cast, reel...don't give up! Fishing properly takes patience. Keep at it! ((Unfortunately, the casting and reeling involves much clicking of the mouse. This can put a strain on your fingers if you over-do it, so don't go crazy. It does take time! And remember, just click on the shadows of the fish. Anywhere else won't catch you anything.))

### Fishing Can Be "Beni-fish-al" (Corny? Yes.)	

Listed below are all the benefits of fishing, as well as different uses for whatever you end up catching. It's nice to know you gain something for spending a large, heaping portion of your suns sitting on your bum waiting for a bite.	

+ Financial gain is probably the most important benefit. Once you catch enough fish to sell at the market, you are able to earn back the gold you spent on the pole and the bait. Eventually, you will earn enough to help with minor repairs or buy some lovely flowers for a friend.

+ With all the fish you catch, not only will you be making a profit from selling them, but you can keep some for yourself! Fish makes a delicious meal when it's seasoned to perfection and grilled over an open flame. Also, if you're the proud owner of a cat or a penguin, I'm certain they will appreciate a fishy treat from you.

+ If you're artistic, you may feel like using the fish for making prints. Taking black paint (or any color, really), you can paint the sides of the fish and press it firmly on parchment. You can sell these quirky prints for extra gold, or use it to keep a record of the types and sizes of fish you've caught. This is also a better alternative to collecting fish...which would quickly become and unfavorable hobby due to the inevitable stench. `((Idea taken from the Japanese art of fish printing called "Gyotaku"))`

+ The Useless Boots you catch are a little too dirty for Aisling feet, but they are quite useful as chew toys for dogs and mongrels. You may also decide to plant flowers in them, as they make perfect planters with all the moisture they can retain.

+ Collect enough Mushroom Caps and you may be able to set up shop somewhere and sell them for an additional profit.	
		
## Games	

Lastly, you can be creative and invent fun games dealing with fishing to make the time fly. Here's a few to get you started:	

+ Fish with a friend and make bets on which species you'll catch first.

+ See how many fish you can catch in a sun.

+ Have a fish-eating contest with family and friends.	
		
## The Tail End of the Guide	

And so ends the complete guide to fishing. I hope I've been able to enlighten a few of those who have sat down and read this booklet, or even aided a young Aisling in his or her pursuit to bettering their lives. Always remember that fishing takes patience, but the rewards you will reap will eventually make up time spent (or wasted!) waiting around on your rump, twiddling your thumbs, with expectations of becoming the fastest fish-catcher in Temuair.
