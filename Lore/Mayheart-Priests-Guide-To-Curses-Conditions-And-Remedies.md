# The Priest's guide to Curses Conditions and Remedies

_by Mayheart in_ ___Dark Ages___

The world is filled with all kinds of spells, it is the very nature of the priest to be a master of both that of cause and effect. Every cause has an effect and every effect has a cause. The great wisdom and intelligence of the priest are used to master this knowledge in varies ways. Some master that of causing ailments while others in removing them, but all priest's at some time learn a bit of both. This guide is to help identify and teach those whom wish to know the conditions I myself have run across.                                     
 
## Curses

Curses come in all sizes and strengths... the key is recognizing the curses being placed to truly remove a curses of the same type. Removing a curses that isn't there can cause slight confusion among your fellow aislings, but has no serious side effects of the receiver of the removal.

## Conditions

Not only are the monsters and aislings armed with curses, they are also armed with an array of conditions to infect and slow you and your group down...

|![](images/mayheart_curse_11.png)|pramh|sleep|Casting a large amount of mental energy, this spell promptly places its victim into a light slumber. Even in mid combat or while casting a spell there is nearly no escape. <br><br>There is no spell to release a victim of this spell, on by actually causing damage can one be woken from this sleep.

The victim can still cast spells, but ultimately the victim is unable to remove themselves from this condition unless they to are a warrior armed with another skill. This skill is known as Ao Beag Suain, offered only to Warriors and only to be used upon themselves.|
|![](images/mayheart_curse_14.png)|suain|frozen/spell|This sleep like spell is nasty in its very nature. Causing the victim to instantly freeze solid, leaving them wide open to any and all forms of attack. Because of the magical nature of this spell its effects are only temporary and short in time. To remove a victim of this utter cold, cast Ao Suain. This will instantly thaw him/her and return them as was before the spell was cast.|
|![](images/mayheart_curse_15.png)<br><br>![](images/mayheart_curse_16.png)<br><br>![](images/mayheart_curse_18.png)|death|_none_|Death, the very end of it all... or is it?

This causes the sprit of the near dead aisling to swirl back into its body.<br><br> Beothaich Deum is the Fae's Drink of life, made while only in their midst with the right ingredients|
