# Aisling Recycle Theory

_by Kurei in_ ___Dark Ages___

As a young Aisling ventures out into the vast regions of Temuair, he or she will be faced with many hardships. Whether it be gaining personal experience ` insights ` or performing tasks for mundanes ` quests `, the young Aisling will have many obstacles to overcome. The manner of how they overcome these trials is what separates these young Aislings into two distinct groups. The two groups are divided into what I have named as "the production group" and the other as "the reduction group". 

The production group is classified as young Aislings being helped by Master Aislings in categories such as gaining experience, weapons/armor/gear, and quest items. These production group Aislings were fortunate enough to find Master Aislings that were willing to help them. This drives the name "production group" as it is this particular group of young Aislings that "produce" at a very rapid rate. The reduction group is classified as young Aislings journeying through Temuair hunting personal experience, and searching for specific items that mundanes have asked them to retrieve for a quest. Unlike the production Aislings, these young Aislings were denied help from Master Aislings usually due to the Master Aislings being too busy or worrying only about themselves and their own affairs. Hence the name "reduction group", for this group is "reduced" to hunting long hours and searching for quest items alone and without guidance.

As both groups progress they each begin to develop key factors the will later define their characteristics and traits. I have labeled the production group factor "dependent", and the reduction group factor is labeled "independent". Each of these Factors play an important role in the "Aisling Recycle Theory". The production group's factor is dependent because they are solely dependent on Master Aislings to help them with any task they need. Whether is be gaining experience or doing quests. The reduction group's factor is independent because they hunt their own personal experience, personal gear, and quest items.

Finally, as the production group and reduction group begin to become Master Aislings the "Recycle Process" begins. A newly Mastered production Aisling is approached by a young Aisling who asked for help in a quest. The production Master Aisling is more selfish, concerned only about themselves and their own personal growth. This is because they produced so fast, that they want to keep producing at a rapid pace. Which in turn requires that the production Master Aisling only spends time progressing themselves. The dependent factor of the production Aisling comes into play here as well. Since the newly Mastered production Aislings were so dependent on other Master Aislings for quest items, gear, and gaining experience they do not have much knowledge of where to obtain a lot of the items needed for quests, or even good places for young Aislings to hunt experience at. All this together leads to the newly Mastered production Aisling decision to deny helping the young Aisling, which in turn creates a new young reduction group Aisling who has to work hard by themselves without help. 

On the other hand, the newly Mastered reduction group Aisling is approached by a young Aisling asking for help with a quest. Since the reduction group Master Aislings knows its such hard work growing as a young Aisling they become sympathetic and offers to help the new young Aislings with whatever they need. The reduction group factor comes into play here since the newly Mastered group Aislings had to spend long hours hunting, gathering personal quest items and gear, they are very familiar with where to gather specific items for quests and what places are best to hunt for young Aislings. This leads to the Master reduction Aisling deciding to help the young Aisling gain experience, and obtain quest items. These actions are what give birth to a new young production group Aisling who is basically being helped with gaining faster experience and faster gathering of quests items.

In conclusion "The Aisling Recycle Theory" shows that the production Aisling will give birth to a new young reduction Aisling and that the reduction Aisling will give birth to a new young production Aisling. The "Recycle Process" demonstrates that neither of these groups, production or reduction can exist without the other, but more importantly it demonstrates that both groups have learned to coexist with each other. While time flows within Temuair so will the cycle forever continue.
