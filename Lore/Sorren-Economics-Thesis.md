# A Thesis on the Economics of Temuair 

_by Sorren in_ ___Dark Ages___

The economics in Temuair are very unique due to the fact that new items are discovered very often and the prices of all items go up and down quite often depending on a vast number of things. This is why theories can give us some of the answers but the rest, we have to guess and draw conclusions pretty much on our own. I will try to provide an overview of some of the aspects in Temuair economics.

## Basics of Economics
When demand is high and supply is low, prices will rise. Since the seller "auctions" the item for the highest price and buyers will outbid each other as much as their economy will allow.

When supply is high and demand is low, prices will fall. Since the seller will be more anxious to unload the item and the buyer will shop around for a better price...

## Price Setting
Many people have the opinion that the prices are too high. I will try to find the reasons and generalize price-setting.
In price-setting we have something called the perfect price.

### Explanation on Price Setting
In Temuair we often see that a lot of people are buying items at a higher price than others, because they need it bad or just have the economy to do so. And in some cases, the opposite will occur as well, because the sellers need money as soon as possible.
As we also often hear and see is that many people discover that there is an average price on items. For example, a dark belt had the price of 1mill gold in average (it had for many Deochs but this have changed recently due to a lot more people being able to go to canals). This price we call the perfect price since it satisfies both seller and buyer.

This perfect price is something that many Aislings strive to learn constantly, so they may know how much to value their items at, as it is normally changing all the time. To be truly good at making money in Temuair, by selling items, you should get well-acquainted with the perfect prices.

The basic principle of price-setting is to count the time you use to collect the items and the value of your time and the amount of effort you have to put into getting it. In Temuair we experience that items that some Aislings rather easily can obtain are at an extremely high price when they sell said items. The reason for this, is that they deem their time more valuable (They have other options to use their time for, that might generate more money or would accomplish more than an average Aisling would.... in their opinion).
Also, to be factored into price-setting is that a large portion of Aislings are very rich. Simply because Temuair has a very free economy and there is no such thing as taxes or other drains that are income dependent that could bring the rich Aislings closer to the poor and that when new places are discovered, the new items are sold at a extremely high price and the fact that the drop-rate or the income of the new place has a tendency to suddenly gets lower IE chest hunting in UD making the first people to get there, get richer than the ones following them.

### Why Do Prices Change
Many factors come into play, when we wish to obtain the current price of an item.

Most prices on items will go down, which is actually very unique for an economy which has an inflation that is pretty high due to the almost non-existent drain on income. The reasons for this could be that people have easier means obtaining the items, meaning their time in obtaining the item will be lowered and the perfect price will go down as well, or it could be the discovery of new items as described below or as I believe most likely both.

New items are discovered very often, this fact has an effect on a lot of things. The price of the most powerful items in Temuair are very often extremely high, making it impossible for an ordinary Aisling to ever obtain it (of course he could but it would take a very, very long time and much devotion). When a new more powerful item is discovered, the previous most powerful item will have a tendency to fall in price simply because the demand has gone down and the supply has gone up, since more people want to get the new item. For the Aislings blessed with enough gold or means to hunt the new item will look upon the old item as obsolete and first try to sell it at the same price they bought it, but since supply has gone up and demand has gone down, prices will fall.

An interest fact in price changes is that it seems that service prices go up while item prices go down.

This again have something to do with the value of one’s time. Since all mayor services are provided by high-insight or ability Aislings, their time gets more valuable the higher the average insight/ab becomes.

## Class Dependent Wealth
I will not go deep into this subject, as every class has good ways of making money.

Each class can gain wealth in different ways. For instance, a pure summoner can flower Aislings for money. This makes some classes gain wealth a bit easier than others. This means that on a small scale some classes are bound to get wealthier than others. For example, priests have little to no repairs thus making their hunt gold-share, that they can keep, higher.

## Mundane and other influence

This is where the drain should be on gold. The mundanes sell for a lot more gold/items than they buy for (I count in items/gold for skills and other services they provide as well) but somehow the Aislings still get richer this has to do with the fact that the way to make money gets more profitable/easy as each ab/insight is archived and the costs gets lower.

There is the fact that it seems that it is the same Aislings who gets more and more rich. These Aislings are normally of the highest ability and I think that it is only natural and fair that the people that have worked the hardest earns and have earned the most.
I know a lot of people will disagree with me, but after new areas was discovered, we saw that after a while that the gold obtained during hunting was getting less. Many people have complained about this but in my opinion, it's the best solution to the problem. because if it had not been lowered, then high-insight Aislings would be even more than now separated from the lower-insight Aislings.
That the gold shouldn't have been that high to begin with is another story.

## Conclusion.

The Economics of Temuair are not easy to figure out. Some of this may be wrong but these are my theories which in simplicity states that prices are ever-changing due to demand and supply. I hope you have gotten an overview of some of the aspects of the economics, there are many more, but these are the ones that I have thought about and wished to share with you all.

All in all, we know this for a fact: Some prices will go up, some prices will go down and some people will get richer. But maybe we can all understand better as to why if we try.
