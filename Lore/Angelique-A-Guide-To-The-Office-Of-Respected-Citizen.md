# Community Service: A Guide to the Office of Respected Citizen

_by Angelique in_ ___Dark Ages___

The office of Respected Citizen is an important office to be held. Without at least one term as one, you cannot proceed further in Politics. This important stepping stone in politics has a great function in society as a whole. A Respected Citizen is a member of society who has earned the esteem of his fellow citizens, mundane and Aisling alike. So, you may ask, what does this mean for me? It means a whole new exciting world in which you have the opportunity to aid your fellow Aisling!

Before you begin any job, it is good to know what tools you will be able to use. The powers of the Respected Citizen are as follows: Admit Citizens, Regionally Tailor Clothing, and Enter the Tutorial. Let us look at each of these powers in detail:

- _Admit Citizens_ – This duty also doubles as a responsibility. It is within the power of each Respected Citizen to either welcome Aislings into the city, or to turn them away, if they prove to be a criminal, or worse, a heretic. The easiest way to ensure you only admit quality citizens is to have an aspiring citizen answer a few basic questions, before granting their citizenship. Some Sample Questions:  

   Who is the Burgess of ________?  
   Explain to me how you feel about the laws of our city.  
   Have you ever been convicted of a Crime?  
   What do you seek to accomplish in _________?  
- By using questions similar to these, you can rest assured that any Aisling you admit will indeed be an Aisling. This tool of the Respected Citizen can only be used while in term.

- _Regionally Tailor Clothing_ – This ability shows how the Respected Citizen should exemplify Community Service. As the only way to Regionally Tailor is to have been a Respected Citizen, it is obvious that the service was designed to help reach out to the Community. How better to get acquainted with people, then by doing favors for them? Regionally Tailored garments make excellent gifts, and can help to make your name better known. With attention directed to you, you can easily show your stands, and climb further on the Political Ladder. Also, the ability of Regionally Tailoring can be used in and out of term as Respected Citizen.

- _Enter the Tutorial_ – Perhaps the most serious duty of the Respected Citizen is to combat heresy. As a foot soldier of the great Political Machine, the Respected Citizen is on the forefront of the battle. They, of all offices, are the only ones who may enter the mundane's tutorial. There, inside the tutorial, they can be the first Aisling that a freshly inspired Aisling may see… And who better to welcome confused young Aislings into Temuair, than the Respected Citizen? If given examples of outstanding behavior early into Aislinghood, rampant heresy could very well be cut down. This ability is only useable while in term.

Now, that we have discussed the abilities of the Respected Citizen, let us move on to the more important issue, that of the expected actions of the Respected Citizen. As an exemplar member of Society, it is only natural to expect exemplar behavior from a promising Respected Citizen. As the pillars of society, they are expected to be law-abiding, and to work in concert with the other officials of the city. A Respected Citizen should report law breaking, heresy, but on the same hand, should also commend displays of Aislinghood ((Role Playing)), and seek to help heretics combat their problems.

The term of the Respected Citizen is short, lasting one double moons. As an Aisling, you do not have to have much political sway to enter office, only the words of a few ((10 clout)) community members who feel you are an excellent example of a Citizen of the town.

Once the office of Respected Citizen is behind you, it opens a whole new arena of political challenge. After being recognized by the mundanes as a Respected Citizen just once, you are eligible to be pressed into service as a Guard. Or, for those who wish to serve their community in other ways, the office of Demagogue can be attained for being recognized four times.

Most importantly, the Respected Citizen can make a difference in the community. With the growth of awareness of city politics, you can find all kinds of groups and causes to join. So, I encourage each and every one of you to try out this office, and help make Temuair a better place!
