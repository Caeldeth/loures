# A Lexicon of Temuairan Terminology

_by Kedian in **Dark Ages**_  
Deoch 151

Proper spelling and usage of common words and phrases you may see in the Library.
This is very much a work in progress.

*Temuair* - the world of Dark Ages. The appropriate demonym is `Temuairan`.

*Aosda* - The ancient civilization that predates the (current) world of Dark
 Ages. The appropiate demonym is `Aosdan`. To refer to the civilization itself,
 use `Aosdic`.

*Chadul* - A Dark God of Temuair, who entered Temuair in the Eighth Aeon in
 Danaan 1813. Before this, there was no true death; within two centuries of
 Chadul's ascendance, mortal beings now pass into his realm when they die.

*Grinneal* - The time period before Danaan, from Grinneal 1 - 32092. This is
 split into ten Aeons, see
 [Timeline of Temuair](http://www.darkages.com/community/his/Timeline.html).

*Danaan* - The time period of the Tuatha. Danaan's sacrifice in Danaan 3292 to
 defeat Chadul leads to the current period, Deoch.

*Deoch* - The god of inspiration. Deoch's flame, or spark, infuses the Aisling
 with true life, set aside from the `Mundane`, who can only toil in rote
 repetition. Danaan's Great Work is carried on by Deoch. With the end of the
 conflict, the first of the Aislings (Dreamers) are born, free from toil as
 mundanes, free to make a difference in the new Atavism Age.
