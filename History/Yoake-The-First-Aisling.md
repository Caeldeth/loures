# The First Aisling
_by Yoake, in_ ___Dark Ages___

## Introduction

In the spring of Deoch 1, Danaan sacrificed herself to bring balance back to the land. All the gods mourned her passing and for a single moment stood against the dark, but the unity soon fell apart, with the exception of Deoch. Deoch was Danaan’s lover, and still mourns her death to this day. He carried her body, and her blood spilled upon the ground. On the spot her blood had spilt, the first Galanthus (Snowdrop) flower grew, a single white flower.

That fall Deoch came to the grove and picked the flower so he could have a memento of Danaan with him always. As he pulled the flower from it’s place, there appeared the first aisling. As he pulled more and more plants, more aislings appeared in their place.

These aislings were doomed creatures. Their souls were forever scarred to feel the joy of love, but only to have it end in sorrow. They lived each day never knowing the future, always striving to be better, and always failing at their attempts. When the gods saw this, they formed their one last act of unity. They pitied the new souls and vowed to help them where they could. They cast a boon on the souls so they would all have hope and a chance to grow.

And so began the age of aislings.

'From this point on, fact becomes what may be fiction. I am merely putting myself into this position of being one of the first aislings and attempting to feel and experience what they did'

This journal was found deep within the confines of the Deoch Temple. It tells us of the first aisling, and how she came to bring the Deoch faith into Temuair.

## Deoch 1, Fall, First Sun

Is this real? The first thing I remember is looking into the eyes of my lord, Deoch. He seemed perplexed at my appearance. I wish I could give him an explanation, but sadly I have none to give. I watched as he plucked plants up from the grove, and more creatures like me appeared. When he was finished, he closed his eyes and uttered a silent prayer. Seeming gratified with his answer, he gathered us all around him. He proceeded to tell his tale, about his life and the woman he loved. He called us a gift from Danaan, and named us all aislings. He put into us all a spark. He told us we could do amazing things with this gift. He led us out of the grove and took us around the land of Temuair, showing us every aspect of it. He took us to the towns and showed us creatures that looked like we did. They were called men, but they did not have the spark we possessed. Deoch told us that one by one, they would wake up as we had and gain sparks of their own. He placed us each in different towns, promising every one that he would be with them always. He placed me last, in a smaller town than the rest. He placed his hand upon my forehead and whispered into my ear, "You are the first of them all. I am counting on you to lead them into greatness. May Danaan’s light shine upon you always." And with saying that, he disappeared, leaving me alone in this new place.

## Deoch 1, Fall, Second Sun

I remember the last words Deoch said to me. I am filled with fear and apprehension about fulfilling that request for him. I wish above all else to please the one who gave me my gift, but I am not sure how to go about it. I began talking with the villagers, slowly making friends and bringing myself into their way of life. They call their town Suomi. Many of the villagers are downtrodden by the recent dark times. But they all have hope for the future. Their sadness pulls at my heart, and I want to find a way to help them. I yearn to heal the scars they hold.

## Deoch 1, Fall, Third Sun

I met an old priest today, and began to learn the ways of priesthood. He admired my wish to help the villagers, and vows to show me a way to help. He taught me spells, and was amazed at my ability to use them with ease. I was surprised myself, but I figure it is Deoch’s gift. I learned spells of healing and protection. Once I master those, he tells me he will teach me spells of attack and curses. I was sure I wanted to learn these spells, but he insisted it was necessary to protect myself against the dubhaimid. I questioned him about what those were, and all he would reply was they were monsters. I could not get him to utter one more word about them. His fright of these monsters makes me very curious about them. Perhaps one day I shall go and discover what they are exactly.

## Deoch 1, Fall, Fourth Sun

I am very frustrated, I can not seem to grasp any spells anymore. What came to me so easily yesterday is nearly impossible to accomplish today. The old priest assures me that I am merely having an "off day". I grew angry and did not finish my exercises with him today. I spent the rest of the day by the stream contemplating what had happened. I was sorry that I had become angry with him, and was going back to apologize when I noticed someone sitting across the stream from me. He had his foot in the water and was staring at me. When he saw I had noticed him, he smiled and gave a little wave. I returned the wave slowly, and walked away. I apologized to the old priest and he forgave me, but my mind was on the boy at the stream.

## Deoch 1, Fall, Fifth Sun

I finished my exercises today, but still had trouble grasping the spells. Today I used patience and assured myself that in all due time I would regain my ease of casting the spells. I returned to the stream, wondering if I would see that boy again. And as if fate had deemed it, he arrived the same time I did. Today he crossed over and introduced himself. He was called Taois. When he requested my name, I realized that I did not have one. When I revealed this to him, he laughed and suggested I choose a name for myself. I thought about a name and the first thing that came to mind was my lord Deoch. He loved Danaan, and I loved him as a master. I thought he might see it as an honor to her memory if I, being the first, chose a name like hers. So I chose the name Danaa. Taois remarked the likeness between my name and Danaan’s, and also stated I had made a good choice since I resembled her. He told me my beauty was the first thing he noticed when he saw me the first day I came to Suomi. He had watched and listened to me as I met and spoke with the villagers. He was about to say more when he was called away to work. I sat in the shadows of the village the rest of the day, watching him go about his chores. As I watched him, a new feeling came over me and settled deep within my heart. Every time I looked upon him, I had a strange feeling. What does this mean?

## Deoch 1, Fall, Sixth Sun

I told Taois about this feeling I had, and he laughed. He said he had the same feeling every time he looked upon me as well, but hadn’t the courage to tell me before. It was then he told me about love. I realized then how Deoch felt about Danaan. It had never quite made sense to me before. After Taois told me about love, he took me into his arms and pressed his lips to mine. My head grew suddenly light and I had a sensation of floating for that brief moment. When he released me, he said, "Dearest Danaa, I have only known you for a few days, but I love you with all my heart." I told Taois I loved him too, because I know I do. We spent the rest of the day together talking about everything. I told him about Deoch and my spark, and he told me about his life. Our parting was the sweetest torture, but I knew I would see him again tomorrow.

## Deoch 1, Fall, Ninth Sun

These past few days have been like heaven for me. I love Taois and he loves me. I have never experienced such joy as when I am with him. Even my spells have been getting better. The old priest calls Taois my muse. I received a letter from another aisling today. He said he is living in a town called Tagor, and was inquiring where all the other aislings were residing. I replied to his letter, and also sent out a few of my own to various towns that Taois and the old priest knew of. Perhaps we will find each other this way. I have noticed some of the villagers are becoming more like me daily. Maybe Deoch’s prediction is coming true, they are gaining their own sparks.

## Deoch 1, Fall, Eleventh Sun

Oh, my heart feels like it has been ripped out. Everything was going so well with Taois, but suddenly he stopped talking to me and seeing me. I went out to inquire as to what had happened, and saw him by the stream. Only he was not alone. There was another girl in his arms. I slowly walked up to them and softly said his name. He turned and regarded me with disgust. He told me to never come near him again and that he never loved me. I ran away crying and ended up in by a building in ruins. Now I truly know how Deoch feels. Having loved someone more than life, then having them ripped away from you in an instant. My spells are worthless now, worse than they ever have been. I feel sick to my very soul. Oh Deoch, where are you?

## Deoch 1, Fall, Thirteenth Sun

Letters from other aislings reveal the same instances happening to them as are happening to me. Are we cursed beings? Were we damned from the start? I can not help but feel a sense of meaningless. Deoch said we were a new beginning. A gift from Danaan. But if we are a gift, then why are we suffering so? I do not think we were meant to be this way. What is happening? If being an aisling means to be doomed forever, then I wish to never to have come into existence.

## Deoch 1, Fall, Fifthteenth Sun

Today truly was a turning point in my life. As well as the other aislings too. I was sitting by the ruins I had come across that horrible day not too long ago, when out of the forest walked Deoch. When I saw him, I ran to him and collapsed at his feet. I began sobbing and begging him to take me away from this awful existence. He knelt down and lifted my chin. He kissed my forehead and told me he had wonderful news. He admitted to me he did not know about the curse the aislings had upon their souls. When he and the other gods discovered the curse, they unified to save us. They brought to us hope, and a chance to better ourselves without utter failure at all times. He promised me a better life, and vowed he would watch over me. With one last kiss upon my forehead, he was gone.

## Deoch 1, Fall, Sixteenth Sun

I am inspired by what Deoch has done for aislings, I vow to praise his name and teachings. I discovered the ruins he had come to me by was actually a former temple. I began to work at fixing the temple and making it into a place of worship for Deoch.

## Deoch 4, Summer, Final Entry

After four years, my work is finally done. In the meantime of all the work being done to the temple, I taught budding aislings about Deoch and what he did for us. My priestess powers grew daily as I committed myself to studying them. I discovered that some of the other first aislings were doing the same as I. We communicated often and set up a system of relationships between the gods from our studies. Glioca became a close ally to me personally since she was the daughter of Danaan. The temple was opened today, with all its beautiful carvings of Deoch and Danaan, and the marvelous statue at the head of the temple. This truly marks the beginning of a new era. I do not fear the future, I embrace it with my arms spread wide. For I know that Deoch with light our paths with truth.
