# Pravat Battle

_By Lynxus in_ ___Dark Ages___

I was notified of an army, being put together. This army was being organized by Novus Imperia, and its Emperor/Creator Lord Ramanayan Caesar. Indeed, I was rather hesitant to join. But being a part of Novus, and knowing the cause for such an ordeal, I could not refuse. For way to long, before I was born the goblins have invaded the Grimlok, mining their Conix stones, their heritage. This stone wasn't of an ordinary nature. Seems, that it's most powerful. This stone, for whom possesses it can summons creatures. For if this fell into goblin hands, it could be devastating for Temuair, not to mention catastrophic for the Grimlok.

Lord Ramanayan Caesar dedicated, and true to the cause of justice, pulled this army together. This was an army of young and old Aislings alike. This wasn't an ordinary army. For all who were represented knew of this tragic history, and also knew the dangers. This army of many Aislings was on a mission. Learn the Conix lore, to recognize the stone, and bring as many as possible to the Grimlok Queen. Ramanayan schooled us in the nature of Conix, with the aid of other teachers, so we young Aislings could recognize the stone. He schooled us in the Grimlok alliance, and what it would take to form one.

We gathered in the Library of Loures one by one, to make absolute certain we knew Conix. For without this information, we'd be useless to gather stones for the Grimlok Queen.

We headed to Pravat, huddled in a clustered group. For we all were instructed to stay together, and follow each command that was given to us. At the entrance, we formed our alliances with the Grimlok, and headed inside. From there we were instructed to attack relentlessly the goblin invaders to kill as many as possible. Ramanayan lead us through the deepest caves, while many aislings tore through the goblin front as if it were nothing more than training. Ramanayan lead us into one of the deepest caves, as we all recognized the Conix stones. This army of Aislings mined as many stones as physically possible. Tired and battered, one by one we gathered and mined as many stones as we could. Ramanayan again, lead us into the Grimlok Queens chambers, so we could offer the Conix we mined. The Queen was more than grateful offering a reward to each of us Aislings. Indeed, it was a great day for the Grimlok, and Aislings alike. For all who were present, we all know the Queen has Novus Imperium's founder Ramanayan, to be thankful for.
