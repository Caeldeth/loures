# The Journals of Tenes

_By NitroTFD in_ ___Dark Ages___

The following is the chronicle of Tenes, the man responsible for the Anaman Pact and the League of Darkness. I discovered his journal while walking through Loures. I walked into the bedroom and was pulled into some sort of maze by a dark force. I ran as quickly as my legs could carry me to find an exit, but I ran directly into a Dubhaimid. It grabbed me and threw me speeding into the wall. I believed that I was going to hit it with a thud and end my life there, but I smashed right through the decayed wall and ended up in a small corridor that lead to other corridors, much like a catacomb of some sorts. I ran through corridor after corridor, as fast as my legs could carry me. I stumbled on what I believed was a rock. 

Laying on the cold stone floor, I looked back I saw that it was an old tarnished book. I opened it up to see the Journals of Tenes from the day he arose to power. This is what was inscribed...

## Danaan 2421; 3rd moon; 9th sun 

Today is my day of glory. I have taken my rightful place amongst the people and I shall rebuild this land to its former glory. Hybrasyl shall live on and I shall do it by any means. I have gained a lot of trust among the lords Adriel and Gratralie. I still am trying to get favorable notice with the lord Malakros however.

## Danaan 2421; 12th moon; 36th sun

I have gained favor among the lords of these lands and I have gotten more respect from the people. There are still those who toil with the Darkness element for power, and I write here for only its reader to know that I have used this element many times to conquer enemies.

## Danaan 2435; 5th moon; 15th sun

Today I have created an alliance that will be called "The League of Darkness." I have created a kingdom with the 6 lords Adriel, Gratralie, Malakros, Jamocrias, Tobias and Suomi. Together we shall create an order of peace. We will rule with an iron fist and create peace within Temuair. Our name, I am not pleased with, but Suomi assured me that it is only to scare away enemies that would dare threaten peace.

## Danaan 2437; 9th moon; 27th sun: 

There is some friction among the lords of the League. They want separate lands and they do not wish to make Temuair one place. This troubles me and I will try to see to this. I will write anything interesting that occurs.

## Danaan 2440; 4th moon ; 12th sun

Adriel slapped Suomi in the meeting today, I got a kick out of that. I found this diary in a pile of old books and decided to continue my journals. 

>For over 20 years he described the growing annoyance among the lords and their space needed. He describes how his age is catching up to him and how he will never be able to return Temuair to what it once was. Let us continue now...

## Danaan 2468; 2nd moon; 6th sun

By the grace of Danaan what are we doing!? We have created the Pact of Anaman. We will live for a thousand years, but how could we become so evil as to accept help from Chadul himself? I am wondering if we bring the rebirth of Temuair or its demise. I only agreed to it if the dead could now be able to leave Chadul's realm. Chadul himself spoke to me and thus, we have formed the darkest alliance in Temuaran history...

## Danaan 2600; 1st moon; 3rd sun 

Not much to write, just adding that the pact worked and I am now 200 years of age. Friction grows stronger and we plan to split Temuair into 10 kingdoms to release this anger. I hope this works, may Danaan forgive me for the pain I have caused.

## Danaan 2601; 10th moon; 30th sun

We have begun to split up the lands around us. Soon Temuair will be in 10 different pieces. I have forsaken Danaan for she has done nothing for me. Chadul is who I now worship. I no longer want peace, but I want to return Temuair to its former glory. I will destroy Temuair before I let these pathetic excuses for lords rule it.

## Danaan 2626; 7th moon; 21st sun

The land is fully split into 10 kingdoms. These times will be recorded as The Dark Ages of Temuair. This is only to keep them at bay. Once they start wanting more power, they will destroy each other while I rebuild this land. Hybrasyl will once again awaken, and it shall be as powerful; as ever, for I shall be at its helm.

## Danaan 2800; 1st moon; 3rd sun

As I expected, the kingdoms hunger for more land and they threaten each other with war. It will be soon when the threats become actions, and the actions bring me closer to my dream.

## Danaan 2846; 8th moon; 24th sun

I have received word that a new lord defies me. This new lord is named Ainmeal and people say he is guided by Danaan herself. He is a useless threat that will perish when he became too much of a nuisance. His blood will run like the tears of lost souls when I 
decide to end his life.

## Danaan 2871; 11th moon; 33rd sun

It seems I have underestimated this new lord for he has a decent sized army to battle me. I have lost a few allies, but thus far, he has none and my armies will destroy him...

## Danaan 2903; 1st moon; 3rd sun

Ainmeal has founded the capital of Loures. I only have Suomi, Feasgar, Massai and Glaic standing by me in this war, I will not allow this miserable little vermin to destroy my chance to revive Hybrasyl, not until I lay on my death bed. Suomi is the last of the original League. War is upon us and ye shall face my wrath!

## Danaan 2915; 4th moon; 16th sun

We are winning this war and we shall continue to do so, as I have predicted...

##Danaan 2918; 12th moon; 26th sun

Our allies have split apart and we are in trouble. Suomi and I are in an argument, Massai and Glaic refuse to work with each other and I am running thin on soldiers. Curse the name Ainmeal!

## Danaan 2921; 3rd moon; 9th sun: 

This is to be our last battle. Treacherous Suomi has joined Ainmeal and his 3 allies. Massai and Glaic have been assassinated and I am left alone with a small army to defend myself. This will not stop me. I will reach from death itself before I let him destroy the memory of Hybrasyl. I can hear them at my very door at this moment. From this moment on I curse Danaan, Loures and Suomi. Danaan shall die in a few hundred years from now. So, I have seen it, so it shall come to pass. Loures and Suomi will never again find peace within each otherâ€™s embrace. This war will once again be relived soon after my death, but the Dubhaimid shall replace my army to battle Danaan.
Finally... I shall return. I draw my sword for they will enter my room shortly...

>The rest of it is smudged and blood stained. I believe this is the lost journals of Tenes and I may soon put it in the Loures Library. His predictions did come true. Danaan sacrificed herself in Danaan 3292. Suomi now rejects Loures and will not allow their ways. The Shadows War was fought and it was Danaan against the Dubhaimid. His return to this realm has yet to be seen. If he does return, he will seek vengeance upon us, and so I pray that he does not.
