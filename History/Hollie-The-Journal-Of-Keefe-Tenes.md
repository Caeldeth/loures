# Journal of Keefe Tenes - A Prelude of the 9th Aeon

_by Hollie in_ ___Dark Ages___

I was browsing through some of the numerous crates in Fiosachd's temple when I came across an old book. The poor old book had seen better days, the binding had split apart and the pages fell loosely between the hard covers. The book was in such horrid condition, I handled it delicately as I wiped the dust away from the dull black cover. As the dust was swept away, the words "The Journal of Keefe Tenes" revealed themselves. Recognizing this name, I became interested in the content this book contained. As carefully as I could, I opened the book. I glanced up and down the page and I began to read...

## Danaan 2229, 1st moon, 2nd sun

Yet another day in this hell I call my life continues. The fighting rages forth into the very streets of my small seaside village. Blood cascades against the night’s frail air as I write. Swords meet screams of the weak, and death touches my senses. Oh, how I wish the Dubhaimid were still the worst of our fears these days, but alas, their weakened bodies pose no more a threat to man. Which leaves man with only one threat.  Himself.

My fear turned into horror when I received a letter from my brother, Astin, but two days ago. Astin lived in Finach, or, or what was left of Finach after the great war of Danaan and Chadul that ravaged Temuair years ago. We had both prayed for the rebuilding of Finach to commence, but as of this last year, everything has changed.

Here is a transcript of part of his letter:

>_Dear Keefe,_  
>_My brother, I miss thee. In the past, I know I have fought you about your move from the large city of Finach, but now I fear that your humble move to that small village was a smart one indeed._
>
>_A year prior to today, we were busy rebuilding our city… But now rebuilding seems the least on peoples’ minds. All are maniacal and crazed, forging weapons that I have never before conceived. I question the need for such arms, being as the war with the Dubhaimid has become nothing more than a joke. None can answer my questioning, as it seems they are not fully in control of their minds! I believe a larger hand is at play… one strong enough to control the minds of men._
>
>_The weapons that are being created are finding the hands of every man and child in our city. When our time should be spent rebuilding our losses, we find ourselves fending for our lives against each other. No longer is our city a city, but rather a hostile mesh of chaos
>Keefe, I know I should run. There has to be better places than this insanity of my people, but alas, I cannot leave. I will fight for my fellows, and for my right to live in my city of birth_
>
>_Danaan Bless,_  
>_Astin Tenes_

If only Astin knew how wide spread the chaos had become. I wrote to him, to explain the violence that had even touched my small community, but alas, the messenger from Finach has stopped coming to collect the parcels of my village.  This has left only the worst of fears in my belly.

I shall continue to persevere with the convictions of my brother deep within me! Onward, another day I will survive and I will not turn to the bloodshed of my fellow men. I abstain from the touch of a blade, as I see no good can come from it.

## Danaan 2229, 2nd moon, 21st sun

There are no signs of the fighting diminishing anytime soon. No longer is the spilt blood of a brother considered unusual in the eyes of the villagers of my city. My mind is at a loss as of what to do! I want to run as far as I can. Every day, I see more and more weapons and hatred flow into my city, and every day, my spirit drops.

I have made up my mind. It has been over a moon since a messenger from Finach has visited our village, and I must journey to my brother to insure his safety. My own safety aside, my family comes first to me. If Astin is safe, I will continue on to a place that the violence and bloodshed has not yet touched.

## Danaan 2229, 2nd moon, 23rd sun

This morning I woke to unfamiliar surroundings. The smell of bread is in the air. I hear the soft sounds of a woman humming in the other room, but everything to my vision is a blur. My head aches to no end and I cannot feel my hands. I notice movement in the doorway.  It is a person but I cannot make out who.

It was then a soft female voice whispered “It is alright, my boy found you beaten pretty badly in the street. He showed us where you were and we brought you here to rest.”

I was confused, and scared. “But, but I cannot see! What is wrong? What has happened to me!” I blurted out in utter fear. I struggled to peer through my swollen eyes, bandages constricting my eyelids so I can barely open them.

The woman began to speak again. “Your face…” she faltered in her words. “I believe your attacker may have blinded you.”
Her words fell upon me like a rock falling from a cliff. I did not want to lose my eyesight! How would I be able to survive these times of trouble with no way to see? How would I continue my journey to Finach? I thought deep within myself, trying to recall the events that had happened that night before.

Danaan has cursed me. God, why did I ever leave my cottage? The very nightmare I wished to escape had hit me straight on, and I had not even left the border of my village.

I remember having walked down the long streets of my village. I was beginning my journey to Astin, when a young boy, no more than 12, jumped out at me, startling me. The lad seemed friendly, but I knew he shouldn’t be out this late at night. I offered the child one of my apples I had been saving for the long journey ahead of me, and told him to run home to his momma as fast as he could. He disappeared into the darkness with his childish laughter trailing behind. It was then, after my defenses were down, that a large beast of a man appeared out of the shadows of the darkness.

He snarled, and before I knew it, his hand was drawn into the air, and I could see the shining blade sweeping down towards me. The sharp blade streaked across my face. My vision became clouded with blood as I strained to see my attacker. I reached up to cover my eyes and felt another blow across my hands. The pain ran through me like hot metal. I fell to my knees, gasping for air.
The man rummaged through my person and mumbled something about being a no good, worthless peasant, and then he disappeared into the night as quickly as he appeared. I was alone, bleeding, and cold. I was dead. Danaan cursed me.

## Danaan 2229, 3rd moon, 2nd sun

This morning I was able to sit up in a chair. My hands still shake, and I can barely hold the quill.  I struggle to see the pages I write upon. Everything that is about me is but a blur. The young lady, whose name I learned to be Julia, and her son, have taken good care of me. But, I believe I have burdened them long enough, and my stay here brings me no closer to the knowledge of my brother’s safety. Julia packed up some supplies for me as I tried to gather myself together, to attempt my journey again. Before I took my leave, Julia stopped me and begged me as a last request.

“Please, come to mass, it will bless you, and a good mass never did anyone harm.” We attended the mass of Fiosachd.  The minister leading the sermon had read scripture written by Fiosachd. I learned through his written word that he was an interesting fellow with a bit of a shadow to him. He was the God of fortune and luck. He seemed to have secrets that no one could ever discover. I listened to his sermon with all ears, and at that moment, I knew I came here to learn of this man, this god. Fiosachd.

The sermon had ended and I found myself alone at the shrine.  The statue of Fiosachd looming before me as I knelt down to pray. I asked for luck, for the ability to find my brother, and for him to be well in these dark times. I… I broke down during my prayer. I asked Fiosachd to please help me unite this torn world, to bring us together, and to stop the fighting and bloodshed. It was then my prayer was answered.

“Keefe, your prayer is sincere and I will indeed give you luck. I will help you find your brother, and I can help you gain the ability to unite this world. But you must never take up a sword against your fellow man for any purpose, other than to fend off an attack and save your own life… you must ever bind yourself to my servitude… in your sacrifice to me, I will make all your wishes come true.” Suddenly, I felt a hand upon my shoulder.  

As I turned to look, I realized it was the same priest who had given the sermon earlier. He spoke, “Come with me young man, Fiosachd had instructed me to help guide you into his way of life and help you understand his words.”

## Danaan 2229, 3rd moon, 20th sun

The morning sun shines brightly in my window, casting its light upon my face. I wake to a new day, and join my new-found mentor Aeron, High Priest of Fiosachd. Forgive my lack of writing entries, but I have been busy in the instructions of my mentor. In the evenings I see him go to the shrine in prayer… He says he prays to Fiosachd for instructions in my teachings. The way of Fiosachd.
The thoughts of Astin, my brother, constantly plague me. I pray to Danaan for his safety, but there is no way I can search him out, not without my vision and the numbness in my hands. The only thought that keeps me focused to the studies of my mentor is the promise of Fiosachd, his promise of helping my brother in safety, and helping unite our torn world.

I must admit, I did not understand at first what my training was to be… or what Fiosachd had in mind for me, his servant. I asked Aeron and he simply replied “I am to train you to be as Fiosachd… a mortal personification of what he would be, if he were a mundane like us. A rogue,” he said in prayer.

## Danaan 2229, 5th moon, 6th sun

So much I have learned! For over a moon, Aeron has taught me, and I feel competent in my studies. I cannot write of what all my training included, for the vast knowledge that I have learned these weeks would take a lifetime of writing to explain.
Fiosachd was a god of many talents as I quickly learned. Aeron expressed that one must be dexterous and full of charisma to survive like him.

I was taught of all the nimble trade skills, indirect combat, and ways to combat an enemy without killing, without the bloodshed that was so commonplace. We learned of “traps”, which have the ability to stun an enemy, or even maim them as a last resort.
“These weapons… these traps are symbolic of the powers of Fiosachd. Hidden and indirect, yet ever strong in their reason,” explained Aeron.

During these weeks, with my faith in Fiosachd, my hands and eyesight began to heal… but not just heal, they grew in strength. My hands grew swift to move and act, to be nimble and quick. My eyes saw beyond the seen world, seeing that which was hidden.
In time, my training was complete, and I learned the ways of the shadows. The ways of the dexterous. The ways of Fiosachd. I became a Rogue.

## Danaan 2229, 5th moon, 7th sun

This eve, I planned to again attempt a campaign to Finach to see my brother’s safety. He spoke to me, and I shall write the words as he spoke them.

“Keefe, you must journey to Finach, but not to see your brother. Your brother, in time, will find you, as he is safe in Finach.”
I was overjoyed by Aeron’s words. “How do you know he is safe?” I asked quickly, with joy.

“Fiosachd has given me this revelation,” he said with a soft smile. “You promised him, over a double-moon ago, that you would bind yourself forever to his servitude. Do you remember that Keefe? It is time to make good on your promise.”

I was stunned. I never took his asking of servitude so literally.  I had thought he meant more of a worshipper than a servant. “What would be Fiosachd’s will?”

“You will seek out the Temple of Choosing. It is a temple where you may continue the work that Fiosachd wills you…” replied Aeron.
I knew of this temple, the Temple of Choosing. It was discovered by Aurin D’Winter in Danaan 1500, and litte was known of it other than it was somewhere on the outskirts of Finach. A mysterious place it was said to be.

“I will find it, with Fiosachd’s help,” I sighed, a thought coming to mind. “What of myself helping to unite the world again?”
Aeron spoke, slowly, as if careful with his words. “You will, Keefe Tenes. But your work is now devoted to Fiosachd. Understand, that your lineage will unite what was severed, and bring the land together as one.”

I did not understand the priest’s words completely, but Fiosachd was a mysterious one. Later in the day, Aeron asked me to sacrifice all my possessions that were not essential, including my journal. He said he would take my belongings to the temple of Fiosachd, and offer them to our God. I agreed, as I know many of our faith had sacrificed such before me.
Thus, this will be my last entry.

Blessed be all who walk the path of the Rogue,  
Keefe Tenes

---

I gently turn through the following pages of the journal, every one of them remaining empty, as if life suddenly stopped. Myself being a Rogue, I already had the utmost respect for Keefe who assisted in my training but I did not know he was the first Rogue ever to appear on these lands. I closed the book and return it to its resting place inside the crate. This book belongs here, here where the life a rogue began and not stuck away on some shelf in the library. 

I sit silently, thoughts of Keefe's life running through me, I am deeply humbled but what I have read After praying to my God, Fiosachd, I decide that I must learn more about Keefe Tenes. I set out towards the temple of choosing where I know he will always be found for he is an ever-faithful servant to Fiosachd. Upon arriving at the temple, I meet with Keefe and explain to him that I had found his journal and had read its entries. I apologized to him for intruding into his personal life, but I was curious about him, about the promise he made with Fiosachd, and that name, that was tugging at the back of my mind, Tenes... I asked him to tell me more about his journey. He smiled, offered me a chair and began to tell his story...
