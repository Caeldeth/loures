# The Betrayal

_By Seara in_ ___Dark Ages___

I leaned against one of the massive stone pillars deep in Abel’s crypt, cleaning me traps and tallying me treasure. How proud I was of me loot, and again counting in me head the number of dwarves whose demise I had caused. Nasty, mean beasts they were and glad I was that they were gone and given me this chance for rest. I started to doze off when I felt a vibration coming from the stone. A soft tremble at first but it soon became a rumbling.as if the stone itself be alive. I jumped away and stood staring, and wondering would it waken and attack? What strange magic could make a rock grumble so? After a bit I realized me foolishness (Rocks moving, bah). So, I stepped closer, putting me ear to the stone to listen, and realized that what was making the stone quiver in such a way was singing... the loud, deep voices of many dwarves coming from below.

Though I knew nothing of their language the song they sang reached into me belly. Strong and vibrant... and yet sorrowful, a hero’s song no doubt, one of lost comrades, and family. A song that gave praise to the dead... I was hypnotized and intrigued. How could such beasts show such heart through song? It was on this day that I became obsessed with the dwarves. I wanted to learn the language. I wanted to know their world. I dedicated me time to improving me hiding and sneaking about skills. I would get close... close yet unobserved. And I did.

It took me many moons to find the hidden cave where the dwarves had sung. But find it I did and huge it was. The cave was at least one hundred paces across and sixty paces wide. On every wall were carvings. Some in a strange alphabet, others were pictures. In the center of the cave, carved out of the floor, was a table and in the center of the table was a fire pit. Around the table were long, stone seats, and fur upon these. The cave was empty now but the pit smoldered from use not to long before I had come. I was glad that I was alone this first time. I took out me scroll and quill and began to copy what I saw on the walls. Hours passed, and me hand began to ache from the writing. But I was determined to get all I could before calling it a day. So, I wrote, and drew and copied ‘til I could do no more.

It was with these odd engravings that I started me studies. Scouring every word-book and language known to us Aisling’ s for any symbol or writing that correlated with what I had found on the cave walls. Finally, in a scroll written by the dark wizard in Suomi I found a poem written in the dwarves’ language and it was translated! I used what I learned from this poem to translate what I had found. Many Deochs have passed since that day. But I have learned much of the language and translate here, for ye now, one of the writings, which be no doubt in me mind, the song which I heard on that first day.

>Orgundul
>
>Orgundul the king of dwarves, was the bravest and most wise
>Until he answered Lord Tenes call and listened to his lies
>Offered land from Telanee to the shores of the Rethanu
>To dig beneath the castle Loures for Tenes great knights to use
>To bring peace upon the land they would travel underground
>And arrive in places clandestine, and the song of peace their sound
>Orgundul desired peace, and was seduced by Lord Tenes guile
>So signed with blood and dwarven sweat in bold dwarven style
>And thus was sealed all dwarves fate for a long time to come,
>To come
>And thus was sealed all dwarves fate for a long time to come
>
>A decree was made that no dwarf could leave ‘til the deed be done
>And so with never knowing we slaved from sun to sun
>The work became a lifelong task for many died below
>And mothers, ‘neath the earth, did watch their children grow
>Rumors spread that Orgundul had signed a pact with Tenes
>An unholy pact with evil, and endorsed by many kings
>Anger flowed and a council formed for tidings such as these
>But Orgundul turned deafened ears to the council’s pleas’
>So we pitched the shovel ‘neath our feet, and proudly bore the axe
>The axe
>So we pitched the shovel ’neath our feet, and proudly bore the axe
>
>The earth we carved had become our home, the place that we now dwelled
>And in battle our advantage, and how Tenes’s knights were felled
>Our battle cry shook the earth, and Loures itself did quake
>The bloodied bodies of knights and dwarves mingled in its wake
>That cry raged for many moons until victory could be sung
>All the damage that Orgundul caused would soon be made undone
>At last on one cold fateful morn a messenger arrived from Loures
>From Ainmeal the message read "what ye now claim is yours"
>We buried our dead, raised our heads, and in pride we claimed these caves
>These caves
>We buried our dead, raised our heads, and in pride we claimed these caves
>
>So watch ye traveler when ye come down, when ye travel deep below
>This is our home ye trample on and our anger quick to show
>To show
>This is our home ye trample on and our anger quick to show

After I finished with the translation questions bombarded me mind. Telanee... Rethanu? What strange lands were these? Or were they simply dwarven names given to lands I already knew? And what became of Orgundul? Any mention of his fate I have yet to find. So much to be learned, and still so much to translate. So, I return to me studies and continue to uncover the meanings of the writings...
