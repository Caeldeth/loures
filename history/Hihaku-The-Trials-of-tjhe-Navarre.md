# The Trial of the Navarre
_by Hihaku in_ ___Dark Ages___

_The pages before you are made of what seems to be petrified tree bark, an unusual method of record keeping. The letterings themselves are blurred around the edges, making them hard to see, and a veil of some gossamer type fabric is wrapped around them to keep them safe. Nothing is remarkable about the fabric, though there remains the faded remains of what might once have been brilliant dyes can be seen. What is remarkable about the artifact however, is the scent, and the feel of the air around it. With no change in temperature, there seems to be a current of wind around it, lighter than a breeze. The smell of it is not that of anything specific, but rather, that of something foreign, displaced. The only way to describe it is like the nostalgia caused by the smells of a place you have not been to in many years, only this pull is not towards a place you have been, but a place you have never seen or set foot upon. You don't want to be here, sitting and reading this. No, you want to be outside, you want to explore. This is the invocation of the scent. Pages of paper, neatly printed, and obviously much newer, accompany this artifact._

## Foreword

To you, dedicated scholars of history, I submit this work. The wooden pages presented were found while fishing off the bow of the boat to Medenia, far from the harbor of Loures but without Medenia anywhere in sight, around the turn of the sails that marked the passing of Shinewood's beach. Once discovered, I immediately recognized them as something of my forbears, but required the permission of my Elders to add to it our oral traditions, as well as other verification from the Library at Loures to properly prepare this work. This work is not one totally of my own, and proper credit must be given to the Baba, or Wise Woman of our people, and to the Pirates who were willing to share their knowledge with me, as there is a tentative connection between our people. 

The account that follows below is the tale of the Navarre, a nomadic people from around the time of the Aosda, but thoroughly distinct from them. Many of our Paramitsha, or legends, have been lost over the ages, so all that can be told is the well known and ingrained story of our decline, and eventual settlement. I hope that those of you who are more learned than I in manners of evidence can verify the legitimacy, or determine the inaccuracy of this recounting. Thank you.

Sincerely,  
Nicholai Hihaku  
Son of Abel  

## Part I: Wanderlust

The Navarre have always been a people removed, separate from the rest of society. Unlike those who seek to make sense of the universe, the Navarre had no desire to delve into knowledge and lore beyond what was necessary for their survival. They were also a very free people, whose ideals stood against things like “true ownership,” even for land. These traits were both beneficial and negative to them. Often they were accused of thievery in towns, as they had a knack for “borrowing” things that did not belong to them, since it was they way of their own culture. They were also shunned by other people since their lack of interests in ancient secrets, especially Kadath to the North, made those obsessed with learning distrust them. 

They moved silently through the ages, from city to city but most often staying away from other people. They never stayed in a city for more than a few suns, and never stayed in the same parcel of open land for more than a moon. They were children of wanderlust, and always a Wind that had long ago claimed them would arrive, calling them to wander once more. Their ties to their family were close, though sometimes some would leave the kumpania, or traveling family, and others would be brought in. New Blood was important to them, for they did not practice interbreeding, and more importantly, they knew the significance of the power held by Blood. 

Another name for the Navarre, a name of disputed origin that was probably given to them by the Aosda, was “Fuil a’Talamh,” which means “Blood of the Earth.” It is unlikely that others knew of the importance that the Navarre placed upon Blood, or the magic they used which often required a sacrifice of it. Perhaps some knew, as the Navarre were often consulted as they passed through towns to trade, in manners of their own mysticism, or Patteran. Some were often skilled fortune tellers, a service that was often sold in towns they stopped in. 

Religiously, the Navarre did not worship any of the Earth-Sea Gods held in esteem today, but they might have known of them. No one recalls if they had knowledge of Chadul, but they did pay respect to Grinneal, as well as the Goddess Danaan, though in their tongue, her name was Daenna. 

The oldest remaining accounts of the Navarre begin in Grinneal 11017, through the oral tradition of their descendents. According to their legend, the Navarre had been going about their life as they normally did, moving from place to place. They were in a period where the main body of them, discounting individuals or smaller groups going into town, had stayed in forested regions for over 500 Grinneals, though still always moving from one to the other as the Winds called them to. During this time, a small band of skilled folk were formed within the Navarre, much like a militia. They were there to protect the others from animals, and to expertly navigate the forests. They were called the Tsurara, though some outsiders referred to them as “Rangers.” They were of course nothing like the Rangers in modern day Temuair. Not to be overshadowed of course were the Phuri Dae, the strongest magicians and diviners of the Navarre. 

The last forested region, admittedly assumed by many parties, that the Navarre were seen in was what is currently known as Shinewood Forest, long before curses were laid upon it. Specifically, a passage that is no longer in existence, which stretched all the way from Shinewood to Oren. This thin, connecting strip of land essentially closed off the Loures Sea with very few outlets. Perhaps of the Navarre had taken the time to learn the sciences of Aosda, they could have prevented the tragedy that would follow. 

## Part II: Hamartia

The Wind came, and it was time for the Navarre to begin moving again. This land bridge was one they had not crossed before, so they had sent the Tsurara ahead to scout the area, and ensure that they would have the safest journey possible. Their trek had begun, and they covered many miles, still under the cover of a rich forest. Then, one night while they were resting, one of the leaders of the Navarre (chosen by seniority), an old and wise man with a wife much younger than him, had a son. The child was born early, and he was very sick. Under the weight of an average newborn, his skin was too pale and he had a sickly cough. Caring for their own, all of the Navarre, and especially the Tsurara who knew many secrets of herbalism, and the Phuri Dae who knew many spells that would heal, went about in search of a cure. 

In less than a few days, a remedy was found that could help the child’s cough, and bring color back to his skin. The child was named Hamartia by his mother, who was one of those not of the Navarre’s Blood. Her actual origin is not remembered, buy by the name chosen, etymology suggests it was perhaps a precursor to the Undine region. Despite a cure being found for the new child, there was a problem with it as well. The child would need to take the cure for several Grinneal, until he was old enough to survive the journey without his medication. Furthermore, the plant used to make it grew only in that region, it had been seen no where else, and it did not keep very well, going bad within a few hours of being plucked. 

A week was given for the discussion, and during that time dozens more children were born, all early, all bearing the same illness. While easy to cure, it swayed the compassions of the Navarre, and they all agreed to stay in the region until the children were strong enough to move, or until an alternate means of taking the cure with them was found. During this time, the Navarre were told not to have any more children, that this area would curse any birth held upon it, and that in the few years it was necessary, their people were not in danger. This was incorrect. 

Several months they lived, many of them pained by not being able to follow the call of the Wind, which grew more and more insistent with its calling as the days rolled by. Until one day it stopped, perhaps needing to move on without them. This day also marked a change in the season, from Spring to Summer. This would mark a change that would make it seem as if all the elements, unchaining themselves, had turned against the Navarre; first the Wind by its absence, and next, the Earth. 

## Part III: Revolt of the Elements

In the few months that the Navarre had spent in that region, for once in the life of their people not having to pick up and move at a moment’s notice, they began to build. Nothing extravagant, simple shacks made out of branches, mud and straw. For the most part the bases of still living trees were used, the Phuri Dae and the Tsurara using their power to make the trees move closer together to form walls, instead of uprooting them or cutting them down. Then, came Summer. 

Unlike other regions, Summer did not simply bring a greater heat, nor did it call upon powerful monsoons as it did to some islands. In this place, the change of season called upon something much more deadly. As the sun spent more time in the sky, bringing warmth deeper and deeper into the ground, the nature around them began to rot. The bark of the trees began to shed like serpent’s skin, and mold began to grow on everything from the rocks to people’s clothing. With it came a sickly scent, but not as atrocious as the bugs who made their way over to them, biting and feasting upon their precious blood. It was like several plagues thrust upon them at once, and they knew then why the Wind had been so insistent that they leave. 

Many died in the span of a few days since the inception, and it was decided that they must move, immediately. Some argued that they should stay as was decided before, because of the children, but the plant used to medicate them had ceased to grow, and the point was rendered moot. Once again they set walking, the way the Wind had last urged them to. Too late though they would soon find out; had they gone the other way, back the way they had came, they could have returned to the lands of the Aosda and find the Wind again. Timing was everything, and while they could have passed the strait of land in the Spring, they would find that the Summer would trap them. 

The rich, albeit sickly forest gave way to desert in abrupt patches of sand and stone. The sands reminded them of the sands of what is now called Nobis; it was assumed by them that this was a simple extension of their beach, and that they would meet society soon again. Alas, this was not the case, for if they had measured their trek, they would realize that they were not yet a quarter passed the long stretch of sea between those two ends of the known world. They traveled for many days, and soon the water they had brought with them from the forest ran out. Luck blessed them, and they were able to find an Oasis. Still, they were in a predicament. They could not bring enough water to return, even if they did they would be tired and no match for the diseases of the wood. If they continued, they would not know if they had enough resources to make it out of the desert. The Tsurara with the highest endurance made several journeys to see how far they could go, and they never found wide land. The sea along this strait would not help them either, for the currents came from the east, making the water both salted and poisoned. 

So they did the only safe thing that they could do. They began to build again, this time around the oasis. For the second time they betrayed their nature to wander the lands, and set up in a single place. The oasis was deep and its waters clean and plentiful. With the plants around it, they were even able to make their legendary Deltumnimos, a potion said to expand the abilities of mind and magic. Soon, by drawing the raw stone from the depths of the sand, the Navarre were able to make a small palace of cool white stone, that protected them from the sun, and provided shelter from all the outside elements. Elements that once they had danced so freely in. 

There was a change in the Navarre during this time, a change for the worst. It was as if their spirits had become squandered by fear of the outside world, and though they still suffered the call to travel on a rare occasion, paranoia kept any from leaving. So they stayed in the desert palace for several Grinneals, prosperous and without any visitors. Perhaps thirty cycles past, before their welcome was worn out. They had more than enough time to figure a way to escape, but they had chosen to stay, and the land it seemed did not want them to linger there that long. So it became the time for Fire to assault them. 

Another Summer came, and it was unlike any other they had had. It seemed as if they sun would set only for a few hours each day, then quickly return, staying at it’s zenith for more than half of the day. It was an incredible heat, and often times the scarce desert trees around their small palace would burst into flames. It grew worse and worse each day. The Phuri Dae tried to counter it, using their power to draw on the magic of the oasis. It worked to an extent, but it was still hot and getting hotter. The Tsurara, now changed from the role of a nature loving Ranger, having by necessity evolved into a lethal desert killer, tried to find a cause for this, or a safe place, but found none. The heat rose more and more, and soon they had to migrate closer and closer to the oasis, lest they be baked alive in the now hot white stones. 

At the height of Summer, the stones themselves that made the palace burst into flames by the glare of the sun alone, and it crashed about them in a storm of ash and debris. They survived, and as the solstice had finally passed, it began to slowly, grudgingly return to a cooler time. They knew they could not linger though, they had not the strength to rebuild. What’s more, forcible draw of the oasis’ magic had killed it, now leaving them in the same space they were at before, those 30 cycles ago. How to escape the desert without water? It seemed their end. 

## Part IV: The True Fuil a'Talamh

At this time, there was a schism within the Navarre. Age was the deciding factor; and it separated the Navarre into two factions. On one side, there were those who had once lived as they had lived for centuries before; a nomadic people in and out of forests, in and out of cities, wherever the Wind made them feel was their place to go. The others, however, came from the people who had been raised in fear of the wild world, trapped in sickly bogs and harsh deserts. Of course, no matter what side they were on as far as belief and experience went, they would not fight each other. They were not a violent people, and the concept of family had been ingrained deeply into them. Discussions followed in the short night that came after the destruction of their home. 

The strongest speaker for finding a way to remain was Hamartia, the first sickly child from the woods before this desert. He was the only one who managed to survive, and had grown into a tall yet lanky, and frail man. This was home to many, and a bad season was no reason to surrender it. Three decades, how much had the world changed in that time? Fear of the unknown, fear of what could not be tamed was his motivation, and the motivation of many. 

In juxtapose to him was Scathach, a forty Grinneal old man, and the oldest member of the Tsurara. Most retired when they were thirty, do to the physical strain necessary to complete the job. He alone of that profession within the Navarre remembered the forests as they had once been, kind. He was also the only one, due to a complicated and now forgotten lineage, to also be one of the most respected Phuri Dae within the tribe. He spoke of how once freedom was part of the Navarre, how nothing could hold them, not the elements, and especially not fear. He spoke of how all other peoples were at odds with each other, sometimes self-destructive, and they alone had lived in harmony with everything for so long. Perhaps untrue, as there were other docile people at that time, but his bias could be understood. 

More importantly, he offered them something that they desperately wanted: an explanation. He told them that this was their trial, their test, which all people must go through. He empowered them by saying they had even been the ones to choose the time, when it was they who decided to ignore the call of the Wind that had guided them for so long. A hard choice and a harsh comment when it was Hamartia he spoke against, but a truth irregardless. They had chosen, and it was time to choose again: To continue this trial, or end it, and return to the Wind. 

The chasm between the two sides had to be ended swiftly. If they had more time, perhaps a compromise could have been reached, but out of necessity of time, it was decided that both sides would try their proposed solution. Those who followed Hamartia sought to prove they could remain by attempting to resurrect the oasis. This solution of course required cooperation from all, all of their magic brought together, so the whole of the Navarre who remained began to work their power over the fallen palace, and the dead oasis. 

To any not of the Navarre, the sight might have appeared to be something rather grotesque. The power of their magic, their Patteran, was held within the Blood. So it was that their blood was spilled through slit palms, and in a giant array the broken stones and shifting sands were painted red with concentric circles and designs of power. It looked like a battle field. They began then the Zapaderin, a sacred dance. For the rest of the short night, and into several hours of the early morning, they danced a chaotic dance, and their magic ebbed and flowed. As the sun rose high in the sky though, the great element would not be shunned by the power of mere mortals writhing down beneath its gaze. The sun broke their magic, their shed blood set aflame like rivulets of oil. Under the heat, the roaming nation collapsed. 

## Part V: Winds of Grace

This is where history gives way in possible legend. The traditions continue to say that Scathach was the only one to go and seek out a way to leave, to call upon the oldest powers instead of the much younger magic and skills that were learned here in the desert. He went to the cursed forest, putrid as it was in the Summer. There, he sacrificed his wuzho, his purity, to cleanse the marhime, or impurity of the forest. For a single day it reverted to the way it was in the height of Spring, rich and full of the magic of nature. He called upon the trees to warp and gnarl, forming two living ships. These ships guided themselves along the waters, and in short order met the rest of the Navarre. 

Hope returned to the people as they saw the ships, and with effort they all went upon them. These two ships sailed out safely into the ocean, and the Wind that filled their sails was the same that guided them to new places. Wanderlust had returned to them. This is not the end of the tale however, as three stories stem off from this point. The Navarre had never sailed ships before, and though they were guided by divine Winds, they knew nothing of navigation themselves. As such, the ships separated. 

One ship made its way to the land of Aosda, where the people who filled the ship slipped into the cities and wild places once more. From there they spread out, and their descendents can be found in any culture of Temuair, although usually private about their heritage, if it is even known. They remain however a people that like to move and many of them have the spirit of adventure to become Aislings. It is no surprise either that of them, many choose to become Rogues. 

The second ship was overtaken by pirates of that time, and assimilated into their culture. From that point on, a significant, but by no mean majority, number of pirates have a lineage that stems from the Navarre. Most of them can be noticed as those very keen with navigation, showing once more their ability to evolve: first as a woodland ranger, then to desert assassin, and finally to a navigator of the sea. 

The final story is the legend of Scathach himself. Made impure by cleansing the forest, he decided not to go with them, lest he bring the taint of that vile, cursed place with him. Also sacrificed was his life, for his magic was no where near enough to command the trees as he did. To perform the task, he let his soul slip from his body through his veins, his Blood of Life forever lost, denying him even an afterlife. He stayed for several days, until he collapsed on the beach, where his remains were taken out to sea by the waves and currents. His legend was much once longer, detailing the accomplishments in life aside from that final one, but those lost. 

So concludes the history of the Navarre people.

Dark Ages
Dark Ages itself, as well as the “Timeline of Temuair” in the Dark Ages Library, and the Dark Ages Manual. 
Both were major ways that I kept my place, and tried not to contradict anything established already. 

Navarre
This name I borrowed from the game Seiken Densetsu 3. There it also represents a desert people that once 
inhabited a forest. That is where the similarity ends however, as they were not nomadic, and my plotline 
in this is wholly of my own imagination. 

Gypsy terms
For ease of reference (finding a Romany dictionary online proved very difficult), I used the Lexicon 
of White-Wolf’s “World of Darkness: Gypsies.” As they say themselves, it is merely a “common argot 
taken from a variety of different Romany dialects.” Admittedly, their definitions were very easy to apply, 
considering they were also written for an RPG. I did not take anything from their setting information that 
doesn’t fit the “common stereotype” of Gypsies, which is very obvious since their historical setting focuses 
on certain individuals through and through, where as I went with a group voice until the end.
