# Aisling Literature

Literature. Stories, poems, and legends of Temuair.

Most of these works have been edited to conform to the Library’s display
formats. Where possible, a link to the original work has been included.

_Works with a octagram displayed next to them represent some of the greatest
treasures of Temuair._

_Works with a question mark displayed next to them have been lost to time, and
are merely placeholders. If you have these works, by all means, get in touch
with us._
