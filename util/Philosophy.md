# Aisling Philosophy

Here are some of the greatest philosophical works in Temuair - theology, magic
theory, racial sociology, inter-village economics, music theory, psychology and
more are treated here.

Most of these works have been edited to conform to the Libraryâ€™s display
formats. Where possible, a link to the original work has been included.

_Works with a octagram ![octagram](../images/octagram.png) displayed next to
them represent some of the greatest treasures of Temuair._

_Works with a question mark ![questionmark](../images/questionmark.png)
displayed next to them have been lost to time, and are merely placeholders. If
you have these works, by all means, get in touch with us._
