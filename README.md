# The Aisling Library of Loures

Collected here are the works of hundreds of players of the game [Darkages](http://www.darkages.com).

This is an attempt by a variety of contributors to:

* consolidate and collect these works of art,
* translate them into modern, readable, and more importantly, sanely renderable formats (e.g. Markdown, and not (X)HTML from 1999),
* preserve and protect these works of art, so that many others may benefit in the future.

The decision to render the library exclusively in Markdown is an opinionated
one, not made lightly. More importantly, it is also not up for debate. There are
[many](http://milethlibrary.weebly.com/philosophy.html) other good places to
find Library entries if you are looking for exact fidelity.

Lastly, please note that only *recognized* works are eligible for archiving
here, for now.
