# The Aisling Library of Loures

Collected here are the works of hundreds of players of the game [Darkages](http://www.darkages.com).

This is an attempt by a variety of contributors to:

* consolidate and collect these works of art,
* translate them into modern, readable, and more importantly, sanely renderable formats (e.g. Markdown, and not HTML from 1999)
* preserve and protect these works of art, so that many others may benefit.

Please note that only *recognized* works are eligible for archiving here, for now.
