# The Aisling Library of Loures

Collected here are the works of hundreds of players of the game [Darkages](http://www.darkages.com).

This is an attempt by a variety of contributors to:

* consolidate and collect these works of art,
* translate them into modern, readable, and more importantly, sanely renderable formats (e.g. Markdown, and not (X)HTML from 1999),
* preserve and protect these works of art, so that many others may benefit in the future.

The decision to render the library exclusively in Markdown is an opinionated
one, not made lightly. More importantly, it is also not up for debate. There
are [many](http://milethlibrary.weebly.com/philosophy.html)
[other](http://darkages.com/community.html)
[good](http://http://loureslibrary.aisling-spark.de/) places to find Library
entries if you are looking for exact late 90s / early 00s white on black
background HTML fidelity, with all the &nbspâ€™s you could ever want.

Lastly, please note that only *recognized* works are eligible for archiving
here, for now (with a handful of exceptions: see the [Mileth Library](./Mileth).

You might also wish to check out our [FAQ](./FAQ.md).

We also have a [lexicon](./LEXICON.md) of common Temuairan terms.
