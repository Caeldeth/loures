4. HOW TO LEAVE FAT CITY

  Fat City provides many exits to its citizens and visitors through a variety of
Mundane connections. Using its world class patronage network, you can go to
many, many places indeed! We encourage you to use our top of the line Doors,
Exits, and even Chutes, if such a need arises. In the event of serious
emergencies, even Ladders may be used.

  Please note that usage of any EXIT, whether authorized, unauthorized,
requested, stamped, unstamped, forced, coerced, or otherwise, is subject to the
FAT CITY TRANSPORTATION MANIFESTO (see _Section IV, "Exit Tariffs, Fees, and

tariff as well as drop any pants you happen to be carrying.
