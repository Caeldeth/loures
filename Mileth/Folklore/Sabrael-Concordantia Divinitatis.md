# Concordanita Divinitatis
_by Sabrael in_ ___Dark Ages___

## Preface
In my many travels throughout these lands, the study of the divine has always fascinated me.  A gift, inquisitiveness, the torment and delight of those licked by the flames of Deoch, which has lead me through many a daring adventure, delving the deepest of ruins and conquering the most formidable of libraries, all in a quest to record the nature of our cosmology for all to observe, wonder over and seek inspiration from.

In this work, several references will be made to Aphrodite’s [_Sects of Temuairan Faith_](../../../loures/Philosophy/Aphrodite-Sects-of-Temuairan-Faith.md), Angelique’s [_Obscurum ac Luminarium_](../../../loures/Philosophy/Angelique-Obscurum-ac-Luminarium.md), and Chloe’s [_Reflections on the Interactions Between the Gods_](../../../loures/Philosophy/Chloe-Reflections-on-the-Interactions-Between-the-Gods.md).  Having combed through the library, these three works show the most relevance to finalizing and detailing all we know about the divine.  As such, where relevant, citations will be marked with a †.  Additionally, illustrations will be provided when possible, but be warned that my humble gifts lie with the pen and harp, not with the brush.

The origins and details of many of these deities have been gathered from folklore and handed down tales, as little can be found in the written works of Aislings for many of these lesser known deities.  In addition, the nature of the divine will be examined through a discussion of the what and why of the octagram, what the relation is between faith and power, and lastly, a cursory introduction to the path of ascension.

## Octagram Theory
For a moment, indulge me in this flight of fantasy.  Picture if you will, the vastness of the night sky, but with the familiar grounds we walk a far distant memory.  We will call this great emptiness space, where one can see the stars and moons and suns that make up familiar figures that greet us from the night sky ([_Solanalein's "Realto I Laiocht Fior Na Spiere_](../../../loures/Lore/Solanalein-Realto-I-Laiocht-Fior-Na-Speire.md)).  In this vast darkness, lit only by the twinkling of stars, see the octagram as a flat plane.

It is there, on this plane, that Danaan made the great sacrifice to seal away Chadul for all eternity.  What is speculated though, is the nature of this seal.  How does it work?  Many would say that Danaan has perished, but as we look around us, we can see her influence.  Her light still shines.  It is here that Danaan is chained, on this great seal, her light shining brightly to keep the darkness at bay.  In this, in her wisdom and glory, Danaan enlisted the aid of what we now know as the gods of the octagram.  Ever at vigil, each for a different reason and purpose, the Gods of the Octagram stand in ritual, strengthening both Danaan and the ward which keeps the great darkness from arising.

For a millennia they have stood, in silent vigil, channeling their will into the prison that has kept the dark lord from returning.  In turn, we, as the inspired dreamers, so too channel our faith, prayers, pleas and thanks to each God of the Octagram.  Such is the forging of the chain that binds the darkness, let us never forget.  For should we fall, the Gods of the Octagram will diminish as well, and then too will Danaan's sacrifice be for naught.  

One surmises that this theory can be evidenced by direct review of the lands of Temuair.  All around us, in this the one hundred and seventy first deoch, faith is in decline.  The minions of Chadul brush against the borders of Chaos as the temples collect dust from disuse.  Should this course not be corrected, I fear the darkness will envelop us all.

## On the Relations of Faith and Power
As described previously, our faith is the fuel of a great cosmic engine.  However, it not only empowers the great seal, but also seems to flow in and around us.  Who hasn't felt the ecstasy of communion, the surge of power, after desecrating a holy artifact of an opposing deity?  The rites to consume and purify a prayer necklace, in particular, fill one with such an energy that it is almost as if you have been marked by the divine.  Likewise, even in holy communion during mass, one can argue that even the stoic Gramailians can't help but smile as they briefly glimpse the nature of the divine.

So then, one can imagine Aislings as small, in the grand scheme of things, but inexhaustible containers, filled to the brim with this divine power.  Should you look within yourself, and picture your spark, shining as brightly as the sun, you know this to be true.  Deoch's gift to us was twofold - one, to raise us from the depths of mundanity, but also two, to enlist our help in the sealing of Chadul.

By his gifts, you, I, and indeed all Aislings engage in an ebb and flow of power refinement and transfer.  One can see the effects on the land when the worship of Luathas is high, as magic also shimmers in the air.  Or when the love of Glioca flows freely, the kindness is nearly palpable in every touch, every gift, every song.  With the waxing of one faith, it too seems a different faith wanes.  As one can see today, worship of Gramail is but a shade of its former self, and the effects can be seen on the land as apostates and their practice of forbidden magic remains at an unprecedented level.

Of importance, however, is the understanding that while the power flow may shifts and collect at one point of the octagram or another, the total balance should remains the same.  However, what if that energy is directed in a different direction?

## Theorem of Divine Ascension
Far before my time, although some of the elders may remember, a group of Aislings gathered and formed what became the Cult of Enigma.  Following no god, these Aislings left a mark on the lands.  Whilst nominally pledged to Sgrios, as his summons were still a force of power at the time, this was quite different.  When a faithful of the octagram calls upon the deity for aid,  creatures come to the aid of the supplicant as an ally, taking suggestions but operating of their own will.  Not so, for the Cult of Enigma.  These creatures were enslaved, used skillfully and with intent to commit atrocities not since seen on these lands.

How was this done?  It is the point of this theorem to demonstrate that the power of the spark, which strengthens the prison of Chadul, can, through force of will, be directed to forces and ideas outside of the octagram.  Indeed, had the cult not been stopped, we Aislings may have witnessed the birth of a new God, one perhaps even as dark and terrible as Chadul.

This redirection of power can also be seen in various other cults that have appeared.  The sometimes "Cult of Danaan" appears without warning, gathering followers for a rush of exaltation to the goddess of light, and then mysteriously vanishing just as quickly.  Indeed, the chosen of the cult has often been described as being able to perform miracles, normally reserved for those pledged to the gods of the Octagram.  Decried as a charlatan by many leaders of the octagram faiths, perhaps they too strengthened Danaan in their own way.  As discussed previously, however, the purpose of the worship of the octagram gods is to refine and enhance power before transference.  Without this process, one is left to wonder of the effectiveness of this Cult's efforts, even if they are able to produce miracles as such.

More troubling, however, are those of the Anaman Pact.  Begun by Lord Tenes and councilors of Loures, this thousand year pact rose to prominence and fell to mystery before the rise of Aislings.  Forever, it seemed, to remain relegated to the lands of fairy tale, all of this changed when the Pact was renewed by the Aisling Hollie and her cohorts in the 8th Deoch.  Since then, followers of this cult too have shown their propensity for miracles, though they are dark and shadowy.  It is said the whispers of these cultists can bring even the most noble and kind hearted Aisling down into the depths of cruelty and pain.  Students of the history of Mileth Politics will see how this small group of Aislings, with their rumored sacrifices, have been able to topple the government there time and again.  It is the sincere hope that, like the cult of Danaan, this transference of raw power to Chadul in exchange for gifts is ineffective.

In each of these scenarios, we see the transference of divinity into places surely unintended by Deoch in his grand design.  These events, while few and far between, are likely to be the source of the occasional breakthrough for the minions of Chadul to enter Temuair once more.  It is with great fortune, however, that these instances seem few and far between.  I worry for us all should they become more commonplace.

## Gods of the Octagram
With the discussion of the dynamics of faith, power, divinity and ascension behind us, now too shall we learn of each of the deities, both real and assumed, that shape these lands.  With hope, a more complete view of the cosmology of Temuair will help rekindle an interest in the divine.  In many instances, the worship of some deities exists only in the past, or in some cases, are assumed to exist and remain undiscovered. `((Information relevant to the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons SRD will be included as well!))`

### __Gramail__ 
Influence: Order, Law, Justice, Science, Vengeance†  
Symbol: Evenly balanced golden scales  
Temple Location: Loures City  
Worshippers: Judges, Politicians, Scholars  
```
(( Begin OOC))
Domains: Order, Unity (UA)
Alignment: Lawful Neutral
Power Level: Greater God
Channel Divinity: Judgment - By expending one charge, your hold spells are now cast as if they were 5 levels higher and work on any living creature.
((End OOC)) 
```
#### History  
Gramail began life as an Aosdic scholar, and later was elevated to godhood by Danaan [_(NitroTFD's "Gods de Temuair")_](../../../loures/Philosophy/NitroTFD-Gods-de_Temuair.md).  Though several stories around his awakening and ascension exist, it is theorized that Gramail was chosen due to his complete embrace of Justice and Order during his time as the First Judge (a position in ancient Hy-brasyl's legal system) prior to the city sinking beneath the waves.  Legend holds that Gramail himself held the trial over the first murderer, and sentenced him through sheer reason and logic, as no laws existed at the time to cover the heinous act.  Interestingly, his trinity also represents the first to fall against Chadul, as well as the only evidence of mortals ascending to deity.

#### Orders & Champions
No current orders exist in the Gramail fellowship that I was able to determine, save rumors of a sect of Gramailians who follow his aspect of Vengeance.  I was unable to locate any follower of this aspect, as Gramailians themselves are rare indeed.  Even Angelique, High Priestess of Gramail for over one hundred Deochs, laughed and said they were tales to scare small children, and that she had never seen  evidence such a sect existing in reality.

Of Champions, one exists in Aisling memory, that of Miramele DuBalde, known as the Fist of Gramail.  The first Acolyte, the founder of the Rucesion government, Miramele was a paragon of Gramail in her time. 

#### Relationships
Gramail allies with Luathas and Fiosachd, holds enmity with Glioca and Sgrios, and is the opposite of Deoch†.  Gramail is a god beset on all sides, due to his adherence to order in a world full of chaos†.

### __Glioca__
Influence: Compassion, Healing, Love, Herbalism, the Fae†  
Symbol: A bouquet of red roses  
Temple Location: Mileth  
Worshippers: Lovers, Priests, Children  
```
(( Begin OOC))
Domains: Life, Protection
Alignment: Chaotic Good
Power Level: Greater God
Channel Divinity: Rebirth - By expending one charge, you may empower Healing Word to fully heal an ally, and additionally heal the closest two allies for half the amount healed.
((End OOC)) 
```
#### History  
Glioca is the only daughter of Danaan, and mother of Cail [_(NitroTFD's "Gods de Temuair")_](../../../loures/Philosophy/NitroTFD-Gods-de-Temuair.md).  It is said that she created the Fae, by one day walking by a dying flower in her garden.  With a kiss, her love of all things living caused the flower to bloom and the first Fae emerged from the unfolded petals.  Matron of the Eldar [_(Nenya's "A Short History of the Eldar")_](../../../loures/History/Nenya-A-Short-History-Of-The_Eldar.md), it is said that the heavy spring rains in Mileth come from her tears as she weeps for her slain children.

#### Orders & Champions
The Gliocan faith has always had a large following, due to her shrine being located in Mileth.  The numerous sects and ideologies within the temple are more than can be committed to paper, yet none have achieved much prominence due to the chaotic nature of the Goddess.

If any could be called a champion of Glioca, the priest Deksar surely fits that role.  Renowned for the literal volumes he could speak on the goddess, I am told that his masses would last for several days at a time.  As the first arena host, he even took his compassion to the field of Aisling glory, tending to the fallen and bruised after each match. 

#### Relationships
Glioca allies with Deoch and Cail, holds enmity with Gramail and Ceannlaidir, and is opposed by Fiosachd†.  A popular goddess, even the dark and foreboding Sgrios holds no particular ill will towards her.  If any could unity the octagram against a threat, it would be the daughter of the one who first united them.

### __Luathas__
Influence: Gnosis, Magic, Craftsmanship, Divination, History†  
Symbol: A green quill  
Temple Location: Rucesion  
Worshippers: Wizards, Scholars, Blacksmiths  
```
(( Begin OOC))
Domains: Knowledge, Arcana
Alignment: Lawful Neutral
Power Level: Greater God
Channel Divinity: Gnosis - By expending one charge, you or an ally automatically gain an advantage on your next two skill checks, and treat such checks as if you had proficiency in the skill.
((End OOC)) 
```
#### History  
Luathas was an Aosdic scholar known for his wisdom to such a degree that he was raised to divinity by Danaan [_(NitroTFD's "Gods de Temuair")_](../../../loures/Philosophy/NitroTFD-Gods-de-Temuair.md).  His detailed histories, advanced studies of magic, and deft philosophical musings are the fodder for legend, as only mere scraps were recovered from the sinking of Hy-brasyl.  It is rumored that the Loures library was founded by his inspiration as his first act of divinity.

#### Orders & Champions
Of all religious orders, perhaps none is more known, and more peculiar, than the Academie Arcanus [_(Veneficus's "History of the Academie Arcanus")_](../../../loures/History/History-Of-The-Academie-Arcanus.md).  An order of wizards dedicated to the God Luathas, was created in times before Aislings, destroyed and shamed into exile, and then reborn as an institute of learning.  What truer dedication could there be?  The only strange part would be the complete lack of priests among their midst!

With that, Veneficus bears mention as the scion of Luathas.  No other Aisling has done more to further his name, or have created such a lasting impression on the minds of Aislings as to the importance of the God Luathas. 

#### Relationships
Luathas allies with Gramail and Cail, holds enmity with Deoch and Ceannlaidir, and is opposed by Sgrios†.  Luathas's trinity has the misfortune of perhaps being the least worshipped in the lands, while also being the most needed.

### __Fiosachd – Luck, Fortune__
Influence: Luck, Fortune, Prosperity, Desire, Shadows†

Temple Location: Abel  
Worshippers: Rogues, Merchants, Adventurers

```
#### History  
While he and his fellow mortals share ascension to the divine, Fiosachd was no Aosdic scholar  [_(NitroTFD's "Gods de Temuair")_](../../../loures/Philosophy/NitroTFD-Gods-de-Temuair.md)!  Tales of his daring adventures, love of coin and gems, and silvered tongue survived even the drowning of Hy-brasyl. Indeed, he is called the first Rogue, patron of quick deals and coin.  Legend has it that as an observer to the ascension of both Gramail and Luathas, Fiosachd convinced Danaan to raise him to deity as well.  Surely, a bargain of some kind had to have been struck to accomplish such a feat.

#### Orders & Champions
As both the patron of Rogues and shadows, if any orders exist in the Fiosachd faith, they hide well.  No particular orders come to mind, but perhaps the many merchants that congregate in Rucesion have a secret allegiance.

While Fiosachd has no known champions of renown, infamy and his temple go hand in hand.  One Aisling in particular meets this level of notoriety, but I will not add to their legend. 

#### Relationships
Fiosachd allies with Gramail and Ceannlaidir, holds enmity with Deoch and Cail, and is opposed by Glioca†.  Ever popular with the down on their luck, Fiosachd's limitless wealth seemingly comes for free.  Little do the desperate know that the God of Fortune always gets his due.

### __Ceannlaidir__
