# The Mundane Library of Mileth: Folklore

Collected here are unrecognized works of various types and kinds (board posts,
random contributions, fragments) from players of the game
[Darkages](http://www.darkages.com).

Due to notoriety (and/or infamy) among players, sheer novelty, or other
importance, they have been included here.

If the Library of Loures is the Temuairan equivalent of the British Museum,
this is that umbrella museum with the really weird hours everyone goes to
when visiting that island.
