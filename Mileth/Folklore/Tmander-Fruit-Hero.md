# Fruit Hero

_by Tmander in_ ___Dark Ages___

Hey, when i was a little aisling, I lived in soumi I had the most wonderful people care for me one of them was the grapes man.  
Hmm what was his name agen, Ahh "Alvar" Yes I ever called him dad :)  
He is'nt my real dad but this is not about me.  
He ever told me about some mighty grapes farmer really long ago.  
It was a very nice story, Also he said the storie was real.

Milk and fruits  

## 1(:: The little boy ::)

Hehe Okey my boy...   
His Real name was   "Milshagol Fredor"  
he was ever called M, F Like Milk and fruit.  
he use to be bullied,  
Hey Fruity boy Drink your milk or else your mommy get mad hahaha...  
He worked on the farms he learned there how to be a farmer but he ever  
wanted to have adventure, he wanted to be a hero. he went evryday to the grapes fields  
And collected the ripe grapes and removed the rotten grapes.  
after his work he went to deoch temple,  
Where he ate some of the grapes and some milk from tagor cows.  
And that he did everyday and every Moon he went to tagor to get milk.  

## 2(:: Fruits in sight ::)

He came back out of breath,  
He said "I AM GOING TO GO~! Adventure Awaits me~"  
he ran to both farmers, He collected cheries and grapes.  
We thougt what is wrong with him... He worked so hard he had a  
whole bunch of grapes and cheries And went out of soumi.  
We followed him secretly.  
he was talking about rats to him self,  
we could'nt hear what he was saying exekly.  
He stoped at some tree's in undine and started to pick apples,  
Why do he need all these fruits...  
we really thougt its because he loved to eat fruits.  
But he did'nt eat more then just a Few apples.  
He gatherd evreywhere fruits.  
We took the ship to abel and walked though abel  
He sang a wierd song ~  

> ~~~~~ Help is coming to mileth ~~~~~  
> ~~~~~ This fight the King of the rats will win it ~~~~~  
> ~~~~~ A Poor farmer? ~~~~~  
> ~~~~~ nobody knows ~~~~~  
> ~~~~~ a tru warrior ~~~~    

## 3(:: MilkFruit In adveture ::)  

OHH HOLY DEOCH !!! He went of the road and not to tagor.  
Some of us ware to scared and went back to the fields of soumi.  
Though I followed him with a few others We came slowly to mileth.   
We saw sometimes a rat passing by.  
we went deeper in mileth, The big horible rats became more and a few  tried to attack me.  
I ran back to the city.  
I wanted to tel evryone about it but mileth was forbidden to go.  
While Milshagol walk deeper and deeper in mileth he went in a hole.  
There ware Millions of spider rats and centipes and a Few bats Flew out of the cave.  
he took his Stick and wanted to beat the rats with it.  
To get them back in the cave. (Crypty)  
he saw millions of rats, the crypty was to small to hold more rats.  
He said to him self i am a warrior i will fight...  
Then a grape fell out of his bag and he step on it. many rats came to him he became scared but he did'nt move one step rats came all arount his leg where he steped on the grape.  

"Pops said" Hehe yes that saved his live...  

## 4(:: MilkFruit becomes a hero ::)

he moved his leg lowly out of the rats.  
Scared he look down to his feet, Phew~ My feed was stil there.  
He moved slowly out the hole And dropped every now and then a few fruits.  
Most of the rats followed him to eat the fruits he dropped.  
The rats came from evrywhere. He took them though West Woods and the East Woods.  
Kobolds and wolfes came from evrywhere.  
MilkFruit Took his stick, WHAA WHAA GOAWAY ! WHAA~~  
Swinging his stick in the air.  
The Kobolds and wolfes came after, into the attack!  
MilkFruit Starts to run And still throwing Fruits behind him.  
The wolfes Growl, The kobolds Scream, They where faster.  
they came closer and closer.  
The wolfes and kobolds ate the mouses and left MilkFruit alone.  
he ran Though Pravat Cave to the canalisation of loures.he Threw his back in there with his adventure items.  
Nobady knew what items were in his bag.  

## 5(:: The happy end ::)  

He went back to soumi he told me all his stories and all his dreams  
He said "I am going to go somewhere else and try my luck and find more fruits i never seen bevore"  
Nobody know's where he went where he is If you been in sw maybe he is there  
somewhere hidden, i dont know~  

Is this story, the truth i dont know.  
I have tried to find out the truth,  
I went to Mileth to the crypty i went to the inn of mileth  
At the wonderful innkeeper "Riona"  
I see there are many a few rats that steal some food.  
I went to look yes there are holes in the inn dhat go to crypt.There are alot rats in crypt and they have often "Fruits" on them.  
Are they stolen from inn or are they from our Hero MilkFruit.  
And i went in the Loures Canalisation What a horible place the rats grow so big as aislings they eat you alive i tell you stay away of the canals!  
Did the fruits make the rats in loures canals so strong ?  
I became to hear of a few hunters there that some rats have a bagg with Adventure gear in it or gold in it.  
The bagg of MilkFruit ?

This was the storie about. Milshagol Fredor
