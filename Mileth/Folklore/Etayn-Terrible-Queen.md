# Terrible Queen
_by Etayn in_ ___Dark Ages___

The blackness of your heart so evident,  
but mine is hidden deep inside.  
I needn't control the whole wide world,  
Nor even that which is called mine.  

The respect I get is offered,  
not demanded, bitterly, from afar.  
But then, I am not a mundane plaything.  
I am not a decorated, shining, star.  

I don't need to be a legend,  
in fact, I need not be known at all.  
What little good I can do here,  
you only try to stall.  

Once known for your spark, what a joke.  
There's not a lot of pay in that.  
Once finding out there is no glory there,  
you turned around and just sat.  

Oh, yes, please excuse, your royalness,  
gee, Bruce has nothing on you!  
Not even multiple fancy garbs,  
we both know that is true.  

This work off the top of my head,  
while I laugh at your delusions.  
Why work at all for someone so petty,  
drowning in their own illusions.  

Yes, surround yourself with armor,  
of the iron and human kind too.  
Bark how you're important,  
loud, so it's easy to chuckle at you.  

No, I am not impressed, most terrible queen,   
of your marks, and garb, and prestige.  
You're a laughable, pitiful, fool,  
Go and kiss the rump of your liege.  

I don't have to kiss any posterior,  
to get a respectful hello.  
All you'll ever get is an annoyed 'ok',  
while you're busy shouting 'No!'  

Behind your back or in your face,  
my position is pretty clear.  
If it isn't official business,  
don't talk to me at all, my dear.

_anti-control_
