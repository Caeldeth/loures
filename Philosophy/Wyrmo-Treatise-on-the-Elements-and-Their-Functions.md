# Treatise on the Elements And Their Functions

_by Wyrmo in **Dark Ages**_

## Foreword

_The elements of Temuair are considered the oldest known code for the ways and
workings of Temuair. They form the buildling blocks, the four pillars of
support for life, as we know it. Yet relatively few studies have been conducted
about these elements. Most Aislings see a certain element as merely a method to
further their political or social standings. Aisling knowledge of the elements
seems to only go so far as the basic understanding that an element can be both
a powerful ally and a terrible enemy. So, in order to increase the Aisling
knowledge, I have conducted this study on the elements and their relationships
to things and how this affects Aislings and their lives. This study is mostly
pertinent to wizards, however, it is valuable to other Aislings as well._

_Side Note: The theories presented in this study are my ideas alone, and,
although factual evidence is provided, most of these theories have never been
proven and likely never will be._

## Theory I

In my opinion, it is the wizard who had the greatest understanding of the
elements. Wizards must learn to harness the power of the elements, but the
must not only know basic facts concerning strengths of elements, they must
know pertinent information such as the location of elemental nodes. In
addition, as has been discovered, the cyclical nature of the four elements

![figure](Wyrmo-Elements-Diagram.png)  

(fig. 1)

makes it easy to comprehend the relationship between one element and two others
but as for the relationship to the last element, this is mysteriously vague.
However, every element must have a relationship with all of the other three. It
is my belief, therefore, that for elemental relationships, each element has an
element greater, lesser, and equal

This relationship helps to create a sense of symmetry among the elements. With
this in mind we can begin to understand the oraganization of the elements and
why they behave as they do.

## Theory II

Another main theory that I propose is that all four elements were created
seperately at different times rather than sumultaneously. In the chaos that
followed the overthrow of the previous system of unity, I believe creag,
element of earth, arose first and foremost. It was a solid beacon of hope in a
chaotic time. But with one element, the world was not stable. So athar arose,
feeding of creag and in time making creag very weak. Creag was almost entirely
destroyed by these winds. However, creag was not destined to be destroyed, and
so found an unlikely ally in srad. Srad, the fire, ate off of athar until athar
was in a crippled form. Srad could not dominate with only three elements,
though, so sal arose. These waters were the strongest element of all because
while sal was taming srad, it also had to keep creag from destroying it. Creaag
was able to return to a stabler state however and athar soon followed. And so
our present order of elements came to be and it has been that way ever since.

## Theory III

My third theory involves the wizards choice of an element for his or her
specialization. My belief is that the wizard is not the true person making the
choice. Inside every pesron, there is an essence of one of the four elements.
This essence, I believe, generally appears around a wizard's (or other
Aisling's) 11th insight when he starts to become more dedicated to wizardry.
So, in this manner, I believe the element naturally chooses the wizard so to
speak. What else could actually drive a wizard to pick the certain element that
s\he does? This drive must be the essence of the element within him or her.
This essence governs more than simply what element a wizard alligns with,
however. It affects his or her thoughts as well. A wizard will be more prone to
attack monsters with an element weak to theirs. For instance a sal wizard will
feel more dislike to a srad scorpion then an athar one. Maybe an athar wizard
would feel an athar student is more capable and be more inclined to mentor him
or her. Also, Aislings tend to take on a personality from their elements. A
creag wizard will be calm and thoughtful while a srad wizard will always be
quick to anger. Through these studies, it can be shown that elements affect the
lives of Aislings in many more ways than they know or realize.

### Creag Study

I present creag first because I believe creag was created first of all
elements. Specialization in creag for a wizard means being hardy and durable,
able to withstand harsh environments. Creag followers tend to have a passion
for nature and animals, being close to the earth. They tend to be careful
thinkers, slow to speak and act but wisely doing so. Creag is concentrated most
in the center of the pravat mountains. The veins of the earth are close to the
surface here, and often creag wizards will come to the the heart of the
mountains merely to feel the earth's energy radiating from them. It has often
beed debated why the grimlok are the principal race embued with the creag
element. I believe this is because the mountain loving grimloks have a passion
for the earth and this is why they settled in pravat to begin with. Grimlok are
kind and hardy as a creag creature should be. Creag is a fascinating element.

### Athar Study

Athar is next in my sequence of elements. Athar, I think, is the least
understood of the elements. Athar is weakest of all elements, yet it can travel
huge distances without being diminished. Athar wizards are sly and cunning as
well as being quick of foot. They are usually scheming on something and tend to
only be talkative with good friends, who are "in on their plans". Athar can be
found sailing over the Astrid plain. What makes athar an enigma is the fact
that few Aislings are able to make the long hard journey to athar's source.
Kobolds are rightly the keepers of athar as Konolds are sly an cunning, usually
only attacking Aislings in planned ambushes. Kobolds often congregate on the
astrid plain to feel the wind, essence of athar, rushing buy. Athar is my
element though I don't think it necissarily better than the other three. It
simply chose me so to speak.

### Srad Study

The fiery element is popular for use by young wizards, as they still have a
fiery spirit in thier hearts. Srad wizards, whatever the age, always have a
fiery spirit and are quick to anger. They are strong fighters and they are
strong willed; when other Aislings have long given up, srads wizards have
merely only just begun to fight. This strong will can sometimes make these
wizards appear igonorant but they are not. It is merely their nature. The
creature associated with srad most often is the goblin. The goblin represents
all the character traits of srad. Srad wizards are the only element that will
accept the goblins as friends. It is my belief that srad doesn't have a
specified location as staying in one location is too dull for srad and no
location fiery enough exists for it. Srad usually follows the goblins and
exists wherever there are strong wills and fiery spirits.

## Sal Study

Sal is a strange element. It is extremely powerful but cannot travel over large
distances. Sal wizards tend to be rare because sal, I believe, is the hardest
element to master. But a powerful sal wizards is a match for anything alive.
Sal wizards are very wise, and are very honest. But they can also be a powerful
enemy. Ally or enemy, they are firm and decisive. Sal is concentrated in the
water lands of the mehadi swamp. The essence of sal is strong as one walks
through the marshlands and by the rivers criscrossing the wetlands. Sal wizards
can sometimes be seen congregating in the heart of the swamp for deep
meditation. The mehadi are affiliated with sal because of their affinity with
water. They are also wise creatures, even though they will not often ally with
Aislings. Sal, in my belief, was the final element created.

## Elements and Gods

The finaly section of my study deals with the rarely explored idea that the
gods of Temuair are each embied with the essence of an element. This parallels
the way Aislings are affiliated with elements, yet I believe that the gods are
more of a physical interpretation of elements, meaning they display what the
element is like physically. My theory states that for each element there is a
god that is entirely descriptive of that element and then one that is only
slightly descriptive. This theory helps to explain why there are so many gods
in Temuair.

### Creag

_Major:_ Cail

Cail represents everything that is creag. He is the perfect essence of
creag.

_Minor_: Glioca

Glioca, while in harmony with the earth is not especially concerned with
animals and other natural objects

### Athar

_Major:_ Fiosachd.

Again, he represents all the traits of athar and what athar is physically.

_Minor:_ Sgrios

Sgrios has many of the athar traits as well, except that athar is not
naturally evil like Sgrios.

### Srad

_Major_: Ceannlaidir

Ceannladir's fiery spirit and strong will show he is the essence of srad.

_Minor_: Deoch

Deoch has the characteristics of srad, just not to such a high degree.

### Sal

_Major:_ Gramail

Gramail is a living image of sal as he is wise but at the same time firm.

_Minor_: Luathas

Luathas tends to be kind and sal, in my opinion. is not characteristically
kind.

## Conclusion

aThese relationships studied between elements and gods in conjuction with the
other theories presented helps us to gain a better understanding of the four
cornerstones of our lives, the elements. Without elements the world would not
have order as we know it. So by understanding elements, we are beginning to
understand are lives, and so see a greater meaning within ourselves. Studies
like this one must keep being conducted in order to furthur Aisling knowledge.
For without the drive for knowledge, we Aislings merely become mundanes.
