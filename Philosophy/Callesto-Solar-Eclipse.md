# Solar Eclipses

_By: Callesto in **Dark Ages**_

`(This is an In-Character explanation of server resets.`

Every so often, something incredible happens in Temuair. This something was so
previously unexplainable that it was sometimes simply ignored by most Aislings.
This "something" is called a Solar Eclipse.

So exactly what is a Solar Eclipse, you ask? Sometimes, our moon passes
in front of the sun. The sunlight is then blocked from reaching Temuair,
causing complete and utter darkness. All Aislings who are awake at the time
then see the darkening of Temuair.

The darkening of Temuair is then felt by the Aisling spark. As a result
of this darkening, all Aislings who are awake lose consciousness for a short
while. Upon their awakening, they find themselves unaware of what happened.
They have very little or no recollection of loosing consciousness or the
Eclipse.

This side effect of the Eclipse does not effect Mundanes. Mundanes do not
have the Aisling spark, and are thus left in the darkness during the Eclipse.

Another effect Solar Eclipses have on Temuair is how it effects the many
monsters and beasts throughout the world. I cannot explain why, as I do not
know, but all monsters seem to fear for their life during an Eclipse. They
quickly run and hide during an Eclipse, only coming out after being certain it
is safe. Before hiding, they collect the many scattered items about the floors
of Temuair. It is said that it is for this reason that dead monsters sometimes
drop rare and valuable items, and even money.

Because of Temuair's location in the Solar system, it is impossible to avoid
this amazing phenomenon. It is also nearly impossible to predict when it will
happen. However, there is a small sign which can be recognized shortly before
the Eclipse.

The small sign of an on-coming Eclipse is, believe it or not, felt by all
Aislings. Your Aisling instincts will kick in, alerting you of the Eclipse.
You'll feel a little dizzy, and suddenly feel very cautious about things. It is
not an obvious sign of an on-coming Eclipse, and usually is not realized until
it is too late.

Although Eclipses do cause Aislings to lose consciousness, they do not cause
any actual harm and should not be feared. After awakening from an Eclipse,
Aislings usually feel and think exactly the same as they did before - usually
without even noticing they had lost consciousness!
