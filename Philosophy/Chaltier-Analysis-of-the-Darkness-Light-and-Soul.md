# Analysis of the Darkness, Light, and Soul

_By Chaltier in **Dark Ages**_
_Priest of the Goddess Glioca_

I would like to begin this theoretical analysis with my thanks to philosophers
and historians who have provided insight into this work concerning the Dark
Lord Chadul, and subsequently Sgrios : Daravon Ragnar, for his piece "Treatise
of the Nature of the Dark Masters", which has provided valuable research in
determining the nature of the dark; Etienne Suarven Lorneau, for his essay
concerning the elements, and their relation to Light, as well as Darkness, in
"De Obscurite et Lumiere"; Rookerin, for his excellent writing "The League and
its Pact of Anaman", as well as his history class during Deoch 6; Dryst's short
essay concerning the discovery of text of the Sgrios priest Grimorvis, entitled
"Farashyid"; finally, Chloe Ta' Null's defining of the Temuairan pantheon in "
Reflections on Interactions between the Gods".

The following work has been written in the interests of providing input for the
philosophical theorists... an extension of the current writings to begin to
understand not only the Dark Gods, but to ascertain their next actions...

Understand this, however - all ideas presented in this essay are merely
ideas... they are not the spoken truth, but nor are they falsehoods written to
please the eye. Philosophy itself is an ever-changing idea - all Aislings are
allowed to believe what they would like to believe, and if this essay should
cause you to analyze your outlook of your planar presence, I ask that you
consider both philosophies, and determine your own conclusion.

As I have stated my preface, let me continue with the subject of the subject of
this essay: the analysis of the Darkness, Light, and Soul.

# Elements, Light and Dark**

In an effort to provide the least confusion in the following piece, it would be
best for me to reiterate the definition of the Fifth and Sixth Elements in a
relatively short passage.

## Darkness, the Fifth Element

Darkness has been defined as the chosen element of Sgrios and Chadul, a
blackness which occurs in the absence of Light. It was originally created or
introduced, supposedly, by wizards in an attempt to control the greater
powers - in essence a bid for domination. It is questionable that this power
was deemed "Darkness" at the time, because we had no previous experience with
the Sixth Element, Light. For the common Aisling, it is by the presence of
Light that we know the Darkness, as the concept was beyond our ancestors
without the presence of the Sixth. It would be in my best interests to quote
Etienne Suarven Lorneau for the remainder of the definition of darkness:

> _"Darkness, as an element in its raw state, has no form. It is like Fire: can
> not be touched, has no weight, no defined shape. What separates Darkness from
> Fire is the way each one is used._
>
> _Fire can be used for creation or destruction. Creation, when controlled by
> a skilled blacksmith, who will use its power to forge the iron and bronze,
> giving the metal life, shape, meaning. Destruction, when put to use by
> unskilled, ignorant or evil hands, who will unleash the energy of the Element
> without any care, letting it free to burn all that can be burned._
>
> _Darkness, like Fire, can be controlled; but unlike the latter, not
> completely. First, because it has no origin like Fire does (a lump of coal or
> a campfire). Darkness is not tied to any material body, thus making it
> impossible to raise its strength by adding more of such matter or lower its
> power by removing some of the nameless matter. This leads to the second
> reason: there is no way to extinguish it. Water will cause it no damage; Air,
> as breeze or hurricane, will not cease its existence; Earth, being inert, has
> no effect on it, nor can it be dissolved in Darkness like in Water to make it
> impure. However, the element Fire can harm Darkness, as it brings bound within
> it the power of the Sixth Element, Light. But being the Light bound in Fire
> not of divine origin, its effects are not as desired, thus most of the times
> making more harm than good at the end."_

_*"De Obscurite et Lumiere" pg. 1, subject 'An Element Above four: Darkness"*_

Etienne has provided ample description to what Darkness in its 'physical'
manifestation, and I will enunciate a few specific points. Darkness itself has
no form... it is an absence of Light, and is therefore subject to the power of
Fire. Only Light can truly 'harm' the Darkness, as Fire emanates this Element,
while other Elements (Water, Wind, and Earth) merely limit the extent of the
Darkness, as they are Matter, where Darkness is not. Darkness pervades in two
of the three Elements, however - Darkness in Earth's deepest crevices and
Darkness in Water's deepest depths. This Darkness can be summoned into a
physical form by the attendants of Sgrios, but such practices have not been
recorded.

## Light, the Sixth Element

Light is said to have been born in the creation of goddess Danaan, to whom we
owe our existence, and is our means of preventing the onslaught of Chadul and
Sgrios. It is said that the capability of building Light was bestowed also as a
significant beacon for the Aisling, a means of establishing Danaan's presence
after her sacrifice to protect her children. There are only a few means of
creating this Sixth element, although research conducted has proven that there
are possibly other means to its creation. One such means is by ignition of a
combustible material, such as coal, which in turn creates Fire, which naturally
creates Light. A second means is through the invoking of Light by a member of
the circles of magic, priestly, as well as wizardly in the casting of magicks.
Whether Light is directly tied to the creation of the magical forces will be
debated next.

## Spell Casting and Prayer

It has been said that Light itself is the reason behind the healing art of
priests, but this is improbable, given the nature of Light. Bestowed by Danaan,
Light is but a means of preventing the Darkness from completely 'overshadowing'
Temuair. If you state otherwise, then it would be best to remind you of the
paradox of the priest of Sgrios. Does he heal others with the Light of Danaan?
Or does he heal with the Darkness? Had there been any influence by either
element, their would be some type of indication of its presence, such as a
darkening of the skin tissue ( a change in colour of the tissue, mind you) ,
but there is none. As of this time in our land's history, it would be best to
define spells of priests, like beag ioc and ioc, as mere manifestations of
innate power bestowed by Danaan upon all Aislings, until this may be proven
otherwise.

# Darkness and the Dark Masters

Chadul and successor Sgrios, by definition of all Aislings, are the motivating
forces of evil, and are therefore subject to connection with the Darkness, and
things whose origination are of dubious nature (which I will not comment upon
at this time). Chadul and Sgrios do not exist upon the Darkness, as they were
not created as Danaan was... but subsist on the soul energy of Aislings,
mundanes, and others. They prey upon the soul energy as their means of
survival, and their priests will do everything in their power to assist their
gods in the accumulation of such energy, in hopes that they would become
stronger in the absorption of the abundant energy. This is not Darkness, as
Darkness does not feed upon the soul, like the Dark Masters. Darkness is merely
an element which is connected between evil and the Dark Masters, who are beings
of desire, and not accumulations of Darkness. Such an example of this
experience would be the account by the wizard Daravon, as he describes one of
his many encounters with Sgrios:

> _"Anger for having me invade his territory and kill him, and
> fear... of the third entity in the room. I then turned my   attention towards
> it and I was overcome with awe. Our existences seemed completely insignificant
> in relation  to the sheer power of that being. There were several ethereal
> structures much like the tentacles of a squid but thicker, coming out of it's
> main body and moving towards the centipede, until it was completely engulfed.
> The tentacles then retreated back and I watched in terror as nothing but
> vestigial energies could be felt from where the centipede once was. The
> tentacles then slowly came in my direction, just like before. But when they
> were about to touch me, something best described as a bubble of pure light
> emerged from my soul, completely enveloping myself. The entity, that I now
> understand was Sgrios, seemed frustrated and kept poking the impenetrable
> shell for a few minutes and then, all of a sudden, I was back at my material
> body. It seemed like my soul had been "wounded" after that though."_  

_Daravon Ragnar, "Treatise on the Nature of the Dark Masters", pg. 1, subject: 'The Impenetrable Shield'_

# What We Might Define as the "Soul" Element

### The Soul Element_

In the previous account of Daravon, we notice that in the falling of both
Daravon and a centipede in the Mileth catacombs, they are taken to the realm of
Sgrios, who is quick to act against both the centipede and Daravon. It seems,
that in this instance, the centipede's energy is being completely absorbed by
this evil being. This energy, as I have stated earlier, can only be the soul
energy of the centipede, as there is nothing for the Dark Lord himself to take,
after the physical destruction of the body. This leads me to believe that this
'Soul' energy is a force unto itself - it is not created by the first four
elements, and is not bound by the elements Darkness and Light - it is a Seventh
Element - the natural power of any being of this, as well as other, plane(s).
As Daravon states in his treatise, the reason behind the protection of his soul
(the Bubble of Light) could only be the work of Danaan, in her last bid to
protect her children from the evil desires of Sgrios. Although Light did
originate from Danaan herself, it is very unlikely that the Sixth Element had
any type of effect upon the powers of Sgrios, who feeds upon souls; therefore,
the legacy of Danaan is actually a 'soul shield' of incredible strength - the
ability to protect all Aislings, as well as their Aisling offspring.

### What is this 'Soul' Element really then?

The Soul Element is what defines who we are on the Astral Plane - it is the
measurement by which all astral beings are compared, such as the Temuairan
Pantheon. For Aislings, after reading Daravon's encounter, it is obvious that
there is skepticism as to how we deal with a greater power... We need not worry
of such an encounter, however, as manifestations of Sgrios cannot destroy
Danaan's Legacy... yet. What truly, then, separates Aislings from the rest of
the world? It is the amount of the Soul Element that was given to us that
separates us. We have been given the capability to grow in strength and
intelligence beyond any other being to this date. This Soul Element is not only
the reason for this growth, but also the capability to wield the powers
without... the magicks that exist within Temuair. Although others have been
able to wield these magicks, the Aisling race has been given the greatest
advantage by the goddess Danaan in all skill- and spell- based mannerisms.
Naturally, one would argue the fact that the centipede was created with the
Soul Element as well, and that all beings have been given the strength to cast
magicks. This is quite true; all beings have a certain level of the Soul
Element within them, which provides a well of potential magic casting ability.
Like I have stated before, however, it is the Aisling, the inheritor of Danaan,
that has been given the greatest amount of the Soul Element, and in the largest
quantities to a race ever before.

## The Relevance of the Soul Element : History

You might be quite frustrated with this latest consideration... but I will
hopefully provide enough insight as to how this affects not only you, but all
of Temuair as well. What will be the final portion of this essay will be to
provide evidence of the relevance of the Soul Element through a theoretical
study of history. To best illustrate this, I would refer you to Rookerin's
essay entitled [The League and its Pact of Anaman](../History/Rookerin-The-League-and-its-Pact-of-Anaman.md) as a means
to better disclose the history of Tenes. At my first class with the esteemed
professor, I suggested that there was slightly more to the marriage of the Dark
Star and Tenes as it seems, and that Chadul could have been a greater influence
to the rise of Tenes than what has been previously suggested. One such example
would be the first battle of Tenes, who lead the good people of Piet against a
power obsessed Rucesion, and soundly defeated them. As Rookerin states, the
reason behind the success is truly a mystery, and none have stepped forward to
clarify. I would not think that, after hardships throughout the kingdom, that a
god such as Chadul would be careless to ignore the potential of the charismatic
leader known as Dorch Tenes, a person in whom he could influence to further his
own ends. 'Why would he further the cause of life and stability?' one would
ask, but the answer is simple - to allow potential for even greater death, war,
and utter chaos. It is then during Tenes rise to power that Chadul first
initiates contact with the ambitious man, allowing for doubt in creating
Hy-Brasyl to enter the mind of the contacted.

Rookerin states that a conversation with a friend of Tenes revealed his contact
with Chadul : " _I... Don't know what to do anymore! I have a chance, there is
one way we can bring peace to our land -- but at what cost? ( Pause ) I will
make the deal, Please forgive me my friend_." ( Section 2, Paragraph 3) This, I
believe, is the beginning of the evil which swept the land at the time. In this
contract, it is possible that Tenes ceded control of his kingdom to (possibly)
an avatar form of Chadul, namely the prophesied "Dark Star", Lady Dubhreal, who
captured the heart of many a male and female. At this point in history, it is
no longer Tenes in control, but the Lady Dubhreal who is master of Loures. An
excerpt from the essay by Dryst describes an important creation headed by the
Dark Star:

> "The priests of Sgrios have been chosen as the ambassadors as death. The
> dubhaimid are not our servants but our kindred, they are the darkness, which
> lies in all of us. A reservoir of untapped power. Hatred, revenge, and spite
> are all part of the human nature and the dubhaimid have attained knowledge far
> beyond ours on how to harness this energy. North of Rucesion an island has
> been chosen to house both the temple of our father Sgrios and our kindred the
> Dubhaimid. According to maps this island has been previously labeled
> Farashyid (meaning place of fog). When the construction of our temple and
> castle is complete we will rename the island, the Isle of Man. For this is
> the place where man will evolve, be reborn into a new beginning. The
> Dubhaimid and Temuairan shall become one and this Island shall be the
> birthplace of that miracle.
>
> Our contact Lady Dubhreal has informed us that Lord Tenes is occupied in
> negotiations on the mainland and that construction on the island will go
> undisturbed. Wizards from Rucesion are already being abducted for the
> purposes of sacrifice and slave labor. Their knowledge of the elements shall
> be properly chained 5th element darkness, when the time is ready. The core
> of this island is said to contain the planar void. It is here that a proper
> link to the underworld can be established but only the chaining of the 1st
> four elements to the 5th can create such a portal. The cavern must be
> completely devoid of what the Dubhaimid call the 6th element light or the
> planar void will collapse. I have included a diagram of the instructions by
> our Dubhaimid kindred."

_Farashyid, translated by Dryst Ravenshroud_  

Why is it that the Dark Star would support the son of Chadul, Sgrios, when she
could support Chadul himself? This is where the ingenuity of Chadul lies...
where the ultimate in events to occur to Temuair _may_ take place.

## Resurrection - A Dark Possibility

"Resurrection", you might think, is a terrible impossibility, and could never
occur in the rebuilding of the original Dark Lord. However, I would think that
there is a great deal of evidence to support such a statement, which will be
reviewed in the following passage.

### The Diverging of the Soul Element

As it states, the essay by Daravon describes the possibility that Sgrios was
given the Soul Element that Chadul did not require during his reign, which
allowed Sgrios to grow beyond the mortal coil and into a being of greater
astral strength. However, there is no reason provided as to why this Dark Lord
would do so without a previous arrangement. As an astral entity, wouldn't you
claim all power to yourself? It would be in Chadul's best interest to hoard all
of the Soul Element... but he chose not to. He has provided himself a link to
the Temuair over world in elevating the status of Sgrios to that of a Temuair
Pantheon god.

### The Dark Star's Creation of the Temple of Sgrios

To reiterate the passage translated by Dryst Ravenshroud of the Sgrios priest,
it is evident that it was by the hand of Dubhreal that the Temple of Sgrios was
created, and therefore the area of the domination of the Dubhaimid and the god
Sgrios. Notice, however, what the priest states as well the function of the
temple: "The core of this island is said to contain the planar void... ...
which will be our link to the underworld...". Granted that the two examples are
taken from two entirely different sections, they are of critical importance. It
states that they can possibly create a direct link to the underworld, which
could spawn the very beginning of the end. Why hasn't this occurred? It is
obvious that they do not have the required amount of energy to sustain the
portal, and have failed a number of times due to incorrect invocations and
summonings.

### The Scar of Sgrios

The Scar of Sgrios has been shown to be the result of Sgrios' inability to
remove the barrier separating the Soul Element of the Aisling and the entity,
as Daravon has described in his encounter. This scar is the degradation of the
power behind the spell placed by Danaan. As Daravon states: "It seemed like my
soul had been "wounded" after that though." Each time you encounter the god
Sgrios, he drains a bit of power out of the legacy of Danaan, as well as a
small portion of the Aisling's Soul Element... similar to a slight cut made by
a knife, which is infected from the start. This infection does not spread,
however... it simply represents the damage done to the shield. Our only
protection...? The removal of this damage to the shield by members of the
priesthood.

### The Final Result

Let us define the situation described above: Sgrios was given the capability by
Chadul to absorb the Soul Element in mass quantities. The Dark Star has
provided a stage to link the Temuair over world with the underworld of Chadul.
And at this very moment, Sgrios is stealing a small portion of Aislings' Soul
Element as they pass from the over world, to the underworld, and back. You do
the math.

## Conclusion

Yes... I have suggested an almost improbable sequence of events that could
change the very way we Aislings live our lives. Similar to what I stated at the
beginning, this is a description what I believe is a terrible anomaly /
misconception that could be of great importance to us. You are entitled to
whatever opinion that you wish to believe, and may speak such a philosophy to
the philosophers of our wondrous institutions. I would only hope that you
consider this as being a possible... viable... solution.
