# Theological Integration of an Aisling

_By Artadelanmir in **DarkAges**_

# Introduction

When thy land's high priests and priestess presented to the mundanes a plan for
a new class system for the theological worshipping many thoughts arose, as
should have in many aislings who have not yet found a true path of religion.
Ever since aislinghood I have been unaware of which religion best fits me, or a
reason for choosing one over another. Although the gods purposes seem clear, an
aisling must seek deep within one's self to find an answer to a great decision
that will affect an aisling for the remainder of his life. But don't get me
wrong, aislings can always forsake or shift their religion, but this is very
undesired and looked down upon to society. Because of my unanswered question I
have sought out many aislings, mundanes, and books that discussed
these religions and have come to a full understanding of each fellowship.

# Important Notices

This article was created not only for the help of an aisling's decision on
religion based on his life, but also his way of life based on his religion. I
have noticed that if there was anything important missing in Loures's
astounding library it would have the significance between the written knowledge
and that of an aisling's adventurous life. In order for you, the reader, to
understand these integrations it is best that you are well informed on the
basic aspects of each Temuairan god. An important thing to notice while reading
the following is how the allied fellowships overlap each other in our every day
life contributing to previous beliefs held amongst the earliest
followers.

# Deoch

The Deoch Fellowship thrives off of the great belief of balance between the
uncontrolled evils and holiness of the land as well as the spreading of light
and inspiration to new forthcomings. An aisling follower of Deoch would want
to take pride in the guidance of new aislings, and spread knowledge of a new
way of living (theologically, politically, socially, or gaining of insight).
They would seek relationships of others who often take life drastically going
through hard times but managing to survive and aislings that have a unique
sense of personality with the will to express themselves.  

# Glioca

Of the eight fellowships Glioca is probably the easiest to understand, but
should never be crossed by any means. Her ways are purely that of light, and
if for any reason an aisling has doubts of his life long purpose this
fellowship is not for them. This is because an aisling that does not follow
his heart fully will show it beyond his recognition through speech on his
hardest of times. However, an aisling that truly follows by his heart will
know this, and take in many challenges in his life with what appears to be no
purpose to the common aisling, that is really an act of kindness that is
intended to spread light, similar to Deoch. A follower of Glioca will seek a
relationship with someone who has a true heart, although may not show it
fully, and will accept their lover for who they are.  

# Cail

An aisling follower of Cail is a very interesting one. They will use the flow
of love and the divinity of natural laws to seek peace with the earth.
Followers will find their relationship through physical actions as opposed to
the mindless chatter they see going on within others, and will also seek
respectability in an aisling. Their worshipping of nature allows them to see
the truth behind an aislings words, thus allowing them to gain deep and long
lasting relationships.  

# Luathas

Similar to Cail, Luathas worshippers will seek distinctiveness in their lover
that bears something behind the chatter, but in this case it is that of the
mind. They live their lives prosperously and should most importantly think
before speaking. However, Luathas has exceeded the line of loving and views
both dark and light as unimportant unless it takes face within their
involvements in Temuair. They basically live off of knowledge they have
learned from elders, often written in books. Their laws are embedded within
their learned wisdom and knowledge which they live strictly by, manipulating
society with them for a greater purpose, commonly committed through
conspiring.  

# Gramail

Gramail is the strictest within his laws. He is the opposite of both light and
darkness, trying to mend either of them to meet the hands of justice. They
seek the fortune found within the preservation of society, which they prosper.
Similar to Luathas they are involved in conspiring, however with Gramail
followers it is usually for the benefit of the people for their own good
instead of the preservation and seeking of knowledge. Their relationships are
to be sought with another who is greatly involved within politics, having a
great desire for control in their own safety to an extreme, and contributing
to the balance where they are helping the suffered and punishing the wicked.  

# Fiosachd

His followers have just crossed the line of neutrality into the realms of
darkness to the slightest degree. This is done when such conspiring goes on
not for the preservation of society, but the preservation of self. These
aislings will innocently manipulate others to meet their own needs. Their
desired relationship is most commonly that of another who has an obtainable
fortune, and not usually a lasting one. However, there is some hope in their
relationships when they meet their match where love comes through their
competition of each other.  

# Ceannlaidir

These followers all strive for the lust of war. They love to hunt with others,
share war stories, battle in the newly built famous Loures Arena, and compete
in any way physically possible. They live by the sword, and shall die by it,
all for the love of it. Their lust for wealth is found within the spoils of
war, although they love to take heroic stances in battle which is often lead
to the romance of new relationships. Although they contribute to death in many
ways, they often do not see it as evil because of their strong belief in
Ceannlaidir and because they are use to this way of life. Even though they
often participate in Politics, they are also nomadic, attending to wars in far
off lands for their own recognition to each other.  

# Sgrios

Some say that Sgrios followers aren't necessarily evil and don't always wish
to cause destruction and harm or political outbreaks. However I would not go
so close as to believing them, for they too hold manipulative qualities, and
in this circumstance are just furthering the acceptance of Sgrios followers in
our society. Many of them have suffered a horrible life and thus have joined,
to try and take back from society was has been taken from them, leaving their
hearts empty. Deoch's ways follow through them in their irrationality and
awakening to new ideas, except that in Sgrios the new ways are that of
destruction and chaos. Their lovers will come from either a cruel fait in
their eyes, or a hope of inspiration and a will to recover their neglected
souls.

# Conclusion

Hopefully these realities of theological integrations have broadened your
thought on the living aisling within each fellowship. I wrote each quality by
its truths, and if you have taken offense to any of these then perhaps your
place lies within it. For those of you who have already achieved a sturdy bond
between your fellowship and yourself should hopefully have increased your
knowledge or lead you in the right direction of the culture behind your
religion.

_At first one must study each religion,  
Then one must look down upon himself,  
And once more upon his deities' culture.  
Once he has acheived a full state of awareness,  
Shall he find salvation within his chosen path._
