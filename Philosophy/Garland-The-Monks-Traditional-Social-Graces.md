## A Brief History and Introduction to the Monk

As it is with the Legend of Cail born of Glioca, our people were born into
oppression. In the 10th Aeon, our home of Undine was conquered by the Empire of
Loures. Fearing an uprising, all the metal in Undine was seized and melted down
by the state, leaving the men and women in Undine without any weapons, or armor
in which to defend themselves with.

However, 5 years later the first monk appeared. Nobody is quite too sure who
taught the first monk. Legends say it was Cail himself who enlightened us.
Others believe we taught ourselves how to fight. And its possible someone from
a far off land may have taught the first of us our skills. But none the less we
had found a way to over come adversity of not having iron, or vast material
wealth, and that our own bodies and nature provided us with all we would ever
need. And thus the monk was born.

What is not written is that over the years we developed a close knit society
that grew in strength, and is still growing to this day, despite all the
suppression Loures has put on our people of Undine for the centuries we have
existed. I find the unique thing about our society is the fact that for the
most part we have been united throughout our existence. While the other crafts
and societies have constantly bickered and fought among themselves for
centuries, the monks have banded together over the years. This is perhaps why
Loures has always considered Undine to be a thorn in its side and the monk
guild to be a threat.

Our tradition grew out of our difference compared to other societies, and thus
we have a rich culture despite our hardships. This document should hopefully
help you understand the monk's tradition, and help all monks understand a bit
about themselves too'

## Undine, the Monk's Homeland

> _Oh Undine, coastal village of beauty  
> Of grand mountains  
> Of massive forests  
> Of the glorious crashing waves  
> Of the calm woodlands  
> And of peaceful folk'  
> May none wish to harm this  
> Place of hallowed beauty'  
> For it would be a tragedy
>  
> \- Loures Bard, written during his travels to Undine and Suomi  

Undine is a beautiful, yet small village where the monk was, in a sense, born
and raised. Although it has little agricultural land, Undine has never been
short on food. This is because there have been many fish over the years.
However, a disaster (involving a wizard casting a spell to put _all_ the fish
on land), we have survived off of food that can be found in the woodlands from
(Cail no karriunce, or _Cail's bounty/food_ ). Off to the south, there are the
mountains, then Astrid, and Suomi. This is mostly woodland or coastal area.
Therefore, monks have learned to survive in the woodlands and feel right at
home when traveling woods (obviously it's very rare for a child monk to get
lost in the woods, since how can you be away from home when you are home?).

## The monk, and his/her relationship with Nature, and chi

Monks and Nature go together like peas and carrots. A traditional monk, from
the day he or she is born is taught to respect, love, and harness nature. And a
monk is always in and around nature in anyway possible. He or she is also
taught the 'dos' and "don't"s of being in any wooded area. Therefore monks will
rarely have any problems with Cail's creatures (conflicts with creatures that
are controlled by the forces of darkness and hate are another mater, though)
simply because they know how to aviod them. In the unlikely event of a
confrontation with a wild animal, the monk knows how simply not to get away
from it. Therefore parents of young monk children don't worry when their young
ones go to play in the woods, and the greater outdoors seems more of a home
then most buildings do for the monk.

It's also been discovered over the years how many plant herbs can be used as
food, and for the healing of the human body. This herbalism has been proven to
be one of the monk's greater rewards of being close to nature, since we are
capable of being able to mix potions for most of our lives. This skill
traditionally was handed down from parent to child for a long time. However,
it's not uncommon for a monk to self teach him or her self to make potions.
With little more then a cloth glove to handle the flowers, and wine as a
preservative, a skilled herbalist monk can make many potions that can vary from
healing poison and wounds (_personica deum_, _hydele deum_) , to soothing
nightmares one may have (_betony deum_), to even soothing an upset stomach,
just a drink to help you sleep. And the majority of herbalism is done _without_
tools made by man (well, with the exception of the bottle to hold the potion).

_For more information on herbal lore, Chloe Ta'Null's _" Herbal Lore" _text is
highly recommended._

The one last thing about the monk's relationship with nature that I should
explain is the using of nature's nochd ( _or life energy)_ to aid one's self.
Within all living things, light or dark, there exists mana of all the elements.
A balance of this energy is known as _nochd._ It consists of all the elements,
including light and darkness, fire, water, air, and earth.

While this knowledge is common place for all monks, only Monks as they start to
get into their Ra _(adult, elder)_ years ever really start to be able to
_sense_ this energy. A Ra monk, who is well trained, can sense the energy of
all living things, and can determine many things about a creature, person, or
place by opening his/her mind ((thus this is where the skill **martial sense**
comes from)). With even more mastery of the martial arts, a monk eventually is
able to even _use_ his/her own energy and the energy of nature around him for
whatever purpose he or she may desire. Some use it for healing poison and
blindness (ao poisien, ao dall), others channel it to make themselves stronger
or more resistant (Mist, Dion, the stances learn from forms). Then there are
those really skilled monks are capable of using any form of energy as a
_weapon,_ such as beag nochd, Kelberoth strike, and poison punch. This is just
to name a few well-known skills. However, unlike wizard that uses entirely the
energy of elements around him or her-self, monks use a _combination_ of their
own chi ( _inner energy_ ) and nature's energy as a whole. Unfortunately, any
kind of metal armors get in the way of channeling this energy, so anything more
heavy then a bracer is rarely used by the monk.

Monks, as the centuries have come and gone, have developed a society for the
most part based around Cail's teachings of harmony and nature. Monks, unlike
other guilds, have never war with one another. Instead, a certain kinship with
one another has developed. This is thus why we call each other _Duno_ (Brother)
and _Duna_ (Sister), out of general respect for one another, as well as love.
One of the first rules a monk knows _is that all others of our kind are
considered family._ Even if they have different religious beliefs then you do,
they are treated like family (Sgrios monks are just kind of the trouble making
brothers and sisters if you wish to think of it that way).

There's not much of a social standing if you really want to think of it that
way. However, it is common to show respect to an older monk by calling him or
her **ra-duno(duna)** ( _big brother or sister)_ , or to call one younger then
yourself **ne-duno(duna)** ( _little brother or sister)_. As monks get older,
they consider themselves big brothers or big sisters to all the younger monks,
and feel it's their duty to keep an eye on the younger kin. As for someone whom
you consider equal, you would refer to them as **Fe-Duno(duna)** _(roughly
translates to "Comrade brother or sister)._ It is respectful to call every monk
a sister or a brother. Your teacher, someone you highly respect, or even your
own parents (when you get older) can be called brother or sister in the
standard language of Tremuir. However, if speaking traditionally to another
monk, calling someone more respected then your self Fe or Ne Duno is considered
disrespectful.

As for the disputes or laws within the monk guild, there was traditionally a
Tsayadim council (_Tsayadim meaning roughly elder, or one who is respected_)
that would meet in times of crisis or settle disputes. This council was made up
of monks who have proven their worth and loyalty to the monk beliefs of
harmony, so decisions were usually reasonable. This council was responsible for
deciding things within the monk guild when there was a time of crisis.

Unfortunately there is no current Tsayadim because the last group was killed
during the battle of the pool shadows nearly 9 years ago' therefore disputes
between monks now are by the traditional Aisling court of law. This I consider
a decline, because it was far smoother and far more reasonable to settle
internal disputes within the monk's own guild, as opposed to the court system
that involves mounds of paper work and red tape...

Then there is the relationship between male and female within the monk guild.
For the most part, man and woman are considered equal and train alongside one
another. It's been found although males are stronger and faster physically,
females tend to be able to focus energy and still fight effectively. Therefore
the more highly trained monks are much less the same, male or female. So no
discrimination weather you are a boy or a girl, and they are trained much less
the same as each other, and along side each other (One of my best training
partners and rivals was a girl actually). Love and marriage more or less works
the same way as any other culture in Tremuir, except the bride isn't as
subordinate to the groom as other traditional cultures.

As a rule, monk garments may not offer as high of protection or look flashy,
but are durable, light, and allow flexible movement. The men commonly wear
Doboks, Culottes, earth garbs, and wind garbs. What one of those they wear
depends on one's level in training. Only the more skilled monks can wear an
earth or a wind garb. Despite the fact that they look simple, a lot of
tailoring skill goes into making the fabric for these clothes. They're usually
made out of either a heavy cloth, or a fine durable silk designed to take a lot
of punishment. As for the women, Bodices are the traditional wear of the female
monk. They range from the earth bodice to the lighting garb. All female monk
clothing are designed to allow easy movement, are durable, and make the wearer
look good as well. However, monk women usually do not wear dresses as often as
other women do, as a long dress or gown would get in the way of one's kicking
abilities.

As stated before, all shields or weapons are forbidden from being worn by a
traditional monk. This is to do not only with the imposed ban on iron in Undine
so long ago, but also out of a sign of respect towards Cail who in turn was
forbidden to use any weapons. Also, the bulky swords and shields severely throw
a monk off balance in a fight, preventing the effective use of any kicks. These
are the main reasons why weapons and shields have been banned from the monk's
use.

Monks (for cultural reasons) also normally do not wear any footwear. This is a
well-known fact throughout Tremuir, but many have wondered _why_ the monk does
not wear any footwear like all other cultures do. There are a few reasons for
going barefoot such as they do. First of all, it is believed since Cail never
wore any footwear himself, that going barefoot would make one closer to him,
the earth, and in turn nature around us (which in fact is a very important
thing in a traditional monk's life). This is why at a Cail religious mass all
followers (not just monks) take off their shoes or boots as a sign of respect
towards Cail and nature.

Another reason for this is heavy boots tend to get in the way of a monk's
kicking ability and movement. A pair of bulky, leather boots would cramp one's
feet, and give the martial artist blisters beyond what you could imagine.
Therefore, the only foot wear monks will wear are slippers, stockings, or other
light more flexible materials.

Perhaps a more historical reason for the bare-foot monk is that during the
Silent uprising of Undine over 300 years ago, whence the monk was born, there
was no iron whatsoever. Therefore boot and shoe makers could not make any new
shoes. So it was not really a matter of choice, but just simple because there
was **no** footwear available at that time.

Therefore, we honor our ancestors who went without shoes or boots, as well as
Cail, by going without footwear. There are a few exceptions to this rule
nowadays, however. This change is due to monks migrating to other parts of the
world, and the fact that people would look at them with scorn for walking into
their houses barefoot, since in other cultures it's a sign of disrespect to
walk into someone's house without shoes on. (It's happened where monks over the
years have been even _executed_ for approaching a monarch's home with no shoes,
and thus were assumed to be showing disrespect towards the royalty). Therefore
monks, as they become more respected, may wear slippers or _light_ footwear
along with their clothes, provided they are not too thick, and allow ease of
use, and are not too flashy or showy. They may also wear footwear for special
occasions, or if it is required.

Not that monks are hindered any by their lack of boots. Monk feet over the
years tend to become almost as thick as leather. And due to a lack of weight on
the feet, they are in turn more nimble then most others. Therefore monks feel
just fine walking over gravel or sharp rocks that would normally cut, say a
warrior's, feet to shreds within minutes.

Greaves of any type may also be allowed to be worn, but usually monks tend to
avoid them simply because they interfere with their chi energy, and the energy
of nature. However, there are magical greaves, which allow the flow of movement
and energy, that exist in Tremuir. These greaves are often worn by fighting
monks who wish to protect their shins, which are vulnerable parts of the body.

## Cail's Teachings and the Monk

> _"The way to strength is not through  
> fighting - it's through harmony,
> inner peace, and becoming one  
> with your surroundings. When you  
> have become one with yourself  
> and nature, THEN you can call  
> yourself a warrior monk"  
> \- My Mentor  

Although monks freely follow any religion they please nowadays, traditionally
the monk was born of Cail and followed Cail. It is seen in the way _all_ monks
act, dress, and fight. Even those monks who follow Sgrios' or Fioschd's paths
still using Cail's teachings (although they do not wish to admit it). This is
why I shall briefly describe some of the outlines of the Cail fellowship.

The two rock solid foundations of the Cail fellowship are _Respect for Nature_
and _Harmony_. Nature is a provider, nurturer, and protector of all those who
dwell within it. It provides us with food, protection, shelter, and can lend
its aid in the form of raw energy if necessary. In turn, it is expected that a
traditional monk show respect, love, and caring towards one's environment, and
all life. No things in nature are wasted for one's material desires, therefore
monks tend to live simply. This is also why Fioschd is considered an enemy of
Cail, since they believe that anything to get them money (weather it be killing
something, cutting down a forest, etc.) is just that ; something to get them
money.

As well, Harmony is the belief that all things in the world happen for a
reason, and that every thing is part of an enormous balance in the world.
Although it is a sad thing when say a woodland animal dies, that creature's
meat will give other animals life. And what is left over from that will become
nurturing ground. As well, as anything dies, there are others being born at the
same time. Thus, is the balance nature, which we all are part of. Death, then
rebirth.

The difference between this and Sgrios' beliefs is that Sgrios believes there
should be _no_ rebirth, and _no_ life and it longs to destroy all things, thus
setting the world out of balance. This is why Cail and Sgrios are enemies.
While Cail wishes to preserve life and nature in some form or another, Sgrios
tries to destroy it. The two gods are at constant conflict with one another
locked in a stalemate' it has been this way forever.

What this means for the monk is that he or she should cherish all life, and
that having to fight or kill something is not something one should long to have
to do. Yet sometimes it is a necessary evil to preserve the life of other
creatures, or people to fight and maybe even kill something. It is a constant
moral battle for us all when you really think about it, that we face every time
we fight.

## Conclusion

Some things in the monk culture still remain a mystery. For instance, who
taught the first of our kind? Was it Cail himself, did someone from a distant
land teach us, or did we "invent" the martial arts? And the magical energy
around us for some enigmatic reason still baffles even the greatest scholars
upon it's creation, and how it interacts with all of us. Some mysteries
surrounding the monk have yet to be solved in over the course of time. Others
still will not ever be solved'

However, I hope these writings will shed some light upon the monk. I as a monk
myself, have found this to be a great honor to be able to write about the
culture I belong to in detail for all to understand, and to be able to learn
and understand what makes me proud to be a monk.
