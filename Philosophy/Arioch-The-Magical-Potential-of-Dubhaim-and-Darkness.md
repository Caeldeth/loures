# The Magical Potential of Dubhaimid and Darkness

_by Arioch in **Dark Ages**_

_A Philosophical Treatise by Wizard Arioch al'Tarasin_

This world we live in is one of mystery and power. Think for a moment upon the
deeds of heroes in legend or even the deeds that take place to this day: power
and grace flow throughout the swordsman as he plies his trade, the tacit power
of the serene monks, secure with no more need for a weapon to be safe than the
mightiest of wizards, the rejuvenating energies sent forth by a humble priest,
the cold whisper of death that accompanies a rogue wherever he chooses to
tread, and the scholarly wizard who bends the very elements to his will. What
is the one thing that all of these glorious Aislings have in common? They
slaughter the Dubhaim on sight.

Perhaps at this point the reader wonders what point there is to be made by
stating such an obvious fact of life. Well, gentle reader, I mean to refute it.

To understand why this process is detrimental, we must first analyze its cause.
Why is it that men go to such great lengths to slay the Dubhaim in their homes?
Is it because of the histories contained within _Seanchas Temuair, Vol. 1_?
That book, its being a basis of our historical knowledge notwithstanding, is by
and large based upon oral accounts and synthesization of the legends of our
people. True, legend has a base in fact, but we would not convict a member of
_our_ race by simple oral history alone, would we?

Surely, you say, if not for tradition's sake it is because they are of
darkness! Foul beings of the netherworld need no mercy, correct? Not precisely.
I would hearken you unto the tale of the scorpion who promised to spare the
life of a turle if it would merely transport said scorpion across a small
river. When in the middle of the river, the scorpion seized the opportunity and
struck viciously, mortally wounding the turtle. "This wound will cause us both
to drown, why did you attack?" the turtle quickly pointed out, and in response
the scorpion spoke four profound words: "It is my nature."

This is true as well for the Dubhaim. Is it not their nature to be what they
are? Who are we to pass judgement upon any other inhabitants of this land?
Though they are not as we are, they have history, culture, and society. We
should not play at being gods by tampering with that. When we decide that we
have the right and privilege to simply crush another civilization, another
race, for our sheer pleasure and peace of mind, then it is not the Dubhaim we
should fear, _it is ourselves_.

What then, you may ask, about when _they_ accost _me_? I do not preach of our
death, and I most certainly would never try and dissuade a man ' any man '
from self-defense. My argument here is that we are simply causing ourselves
problems as well as inflicting moral dilemma that is unnecessary in the
extreme, especially when weighed against the possible benefits responsible
utilization of the dark forces may achieve.

_Seanchas_ speaks of such things, you say, and it points out the folly of
association with the Shadow! Put simply, no. Look closely at what is written
and read between the lines. Firstly, we must realize that Darkness was brought
forth as an element by us, so we are in fact that which spawned the Dubhaim
Race. Why effect a change in the order of things such as this without benefit?
We certainly know that our ancestors were hedonistic and arrogant, for the
uses of magic at that time were mainly for the creation of opulence and the
decimation of one's enemies. Keeping in line with this trend, the Wizards at
the time must have harnessed some aspect of the darkness that allowed them
benefit in either war, peace, or both.

Another mention of the Dubhaim in our records comes from the tale of the
League of Darkness. In this, Lord Tenes entered into a pact with seven others
to unite the realms under one government. The significance of this is that one
of those entering into this pact was a member of the Dubhaim Race. This is
indicative not of perversion of the Lords, but of the ability for our culture
and theirs to interface for mutual gain, as must have happened in days long
forgotten. We should also assume that this being who entered into the pact was
not exceptional, because also our records speak of sane, right-minded people
fighting under the banner of Chadul against Danaan. Is it such a stretch to
assume that these were scholars such as myself attempting to preserve a facet
of the Art?

The above account most likely goes against everything you have been taught.
That would only make sense, because Ainmeal and his forces were victorious
over Tenes, and history is written only by the victors. With the Light's
victory, Ainmeal wished to destroy all information relating to the benefit of
working with Darkness in order to keep his rule secure as well as his goddess
happy. That, it can be said, is what this all boils down to: a magical tool
that developed into a religious civil war. All religious genocides involve the
vilification of the defeated foe, and this is no different.

Perhaps by now you think me a madman or a follower of Evil. I am neither. I am
simply a scholar with a wish to reclaim the Old Knowledge for the benefit of
our civilization, and the only way that we can do that is to cast aside our
old and ingrown prejudices. We must look with an unclouded eye at the Dubhaim
and recognize them as a civilization, as a people. That step is the first in
halting their wholesale slaughter. Defend yourselves if need be, but do not
try and obliterate a culture from which so much can be learned and gained! It
is our goal, our responsibility, to reclaim the knowledge that has been lost
in a haze of war, prejudice, and strife, and then utilize that for the
betterment of our lives and kingdoms from here until the end of time.
