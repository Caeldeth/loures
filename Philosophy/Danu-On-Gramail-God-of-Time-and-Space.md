# On Gramail: God of Time and Space

Gramail is possibly the most powerful god of the octogram. Why, might you ask,
would the god of Law be more powerful than the others? It is not only the laws
penned by self important Legislators that lie within His dominion; it is the
laws that bind the very fabric of our existence within Temuair.

Gramail is also the god of Natural Law. While we may not consciously think of
these laws, they govern us even more so than the laws of the towns. For Gramail
to have dominion over these things gives Him immense power. Nearly everything
imaginable is bound by the natural laws, and thus nearly everything can be
manipulated in some way by Gramail

With His power, Gramail could remove even the very forces that keep our feet
planted to the ground. We would all suddenly float to the heavens, perhaps
never to return. Indeed, many things can be done while in control of natural
law. Lord Gramail is known to have special dominion over two particular aspects
of Natural Law: Space and Time.

Every living thing is at the mercy of time. We grow tired and old with its
passage, and we're often trying to accomplish things within a set amount of
time. A god with dominion over time would then surely have powers great enough
to commit mighty acts.

> Against false laws of heretics
> Against spells of woman and smiths and wizards
> Against every knowledge that corrupts manâ€™s body and soul..."

Gramail does not use His dominion over time with folly. The closest ability
even His most devout followers have to control time is to remove enchantments.
While some may not feel this is a time-related ability, the very nature of His
powers allows for his followers to reverse the time of their very bodies. This
supplication makes it as if the enchantment had never been afflicted upon the
caster at all.

His abilities to peer into the future in order to see what lays ahead allows
Him to grant His loyal followers prophesies. This holy gift allows aislings to
change or stop events; creating the possibility of a better future. It could be
said that the impressive foresight of His followers helps them to become such
accomplished politicians.

Though He does not grant many obvious gifts of time to His followers, He still
has many powers at His disposal. The most obvious would be to turn back time;
allowing for the flow of events to change - thus changing the present. Should
He so be inclined, He could prevent or cause wars; giving Him some power over
Ceannlaidir.

> By the right mixture, one near death can be snatched away from the brink.
> By the powers of the gods allowing, the touch of death can be wiped away..."_

Lord Gramail is also able to alter the age of a person; to make them old or
even bring them to an early death. Imagine being at the peak of your youth one
moment and a decrepit old man the next. On the opposite side of the coin, He
could grant someone eternal youth; thus giving Him a degree of power over
Sgrios. This is, perhaps, another reason for the animosity between the two
gods.

Finally, Gramail also has the ability to make time stand still. While it is
impossible for us to know how often this power is used (if we are frozen along
with time it will be as nothing has changed), He can use such a power to aid a
pious follower while they are in battle. This would allow for the worshiper to
smite their opponent while they remain frozen.

Space is something that is difficult to define. Everything exists within it,
and yet we can pass through large seemingly empty spaces. Gramail, in His
infinite power, is able to control space as well.

Gramail uses his dominion over space a little more liberally with His devotees.
Followers of Gramail are commonly known to supplicate scrolls that will bring
an aisling to any town. They are also able to bend the fabrics of space to
return to their homes. In Deochs past, members of His fellowship had the powers
to travel to many locations through these bends in space, but Gramail took this
ability from aislings due to abuse.

> You see the edge of the village before you."

Aislings who worship at the alter in Mileth will undoubted be blessed by
Gramail. For their personal piety, Gramail will bend the fabrics of space for
aislings of any faith to bring them across Mileth. This is a gift He chooses to
share quite freely.

Gramail has many more powers over space, which He chooses not to use thanks
only to his righteousness. This is a blessing, for these mighty abilities could
wreak havoc instantly.

He has the ability to bring large groups of aislings anywhere, or even send a
whole village into the sun. He need only bend the space around whatever he
wishes and every aisling and mundane could be lost amongst the stars.

Should He choose, he can even blink an aisling (or anything, for that matter)
to a realm of nothingness - or even to nonexistence itself. This is a true
oblivion that an unlucky few ever know.

These mighty gifts are only some of the powers He possesses due to his dominion
over Natural Law. If this is only a fraction of His power, imagine what else He
is capable of. I will leave that to the imaginations of the readers.

Remember this the next time you choose to think of Gramail as the weakest of
the gods; for He may just prove you wrong.
