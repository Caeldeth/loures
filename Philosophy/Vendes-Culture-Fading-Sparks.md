# Culture; fading sparks.

_by Vendes in **Dark Ages**_

Throughout history, there is a single repeated pattern, which every
civilization eventually follows. This pattern is that of the rise and peak,
plateau, and eventual decline of the established cultures.
Perhaps the most poignant example of this pattern is that of Hy-brasyl. A
civilization unrivaled and unequaled, that rose to the pinnacle of success,
before slowly destroying itself. And still, we reach to it as an example of
what we wish to obtain. Perhaps the phrase " _Those who do not learn from the
past will be doomed to repeat it._ "

The following is a look at the current state of the various cultures contained
in Temuair.

## The Grimlok

The Grimlok culture is an unusual one, especially from a sociological
standpoint. If we attempted to label them with one of the above terms, it would
be logical to choose the plateau stage. Their numbers have not increased enough
to be noticeable, they've never been seen in any territory other than the caves
\- which leads to the assumption that the society is not growing at a rate high
enough for them to search out new territories. A society in its rise or peak
would be expected to grow, and a society in decline would be
likely to shrink.

As of my last journey into Pravat, however, the Grimlok alone held Pravat. This
leads to a few interesting posibilities - one being that the Goblins retreated,
for reasons unknown - the other, however, is much more captivating. Is it
possible for a society in its decline, given the right (forced) conditions, to
revert to the stage of rising civilization? It would stand to reason, if this
is even a plausible posibility, to assume that it would be a fragile state -
not being part of the natural order of things. However, the possibility alone
raises interesting questions on the stabilization and growth of declining
societies...

## The Goblins

The Goblins have formed three basically distinct and seperate tribes as of this
date. There are the Goblins of Pravat, the Wood Goblins, and the Undine
Goblins.

We'll look at the Goblins of Pravat, first. As of this date, only Bahadir
and his assistant remain - and they do not enter the caves proper. It is no
secret that Loures had a pact with the goblins during the Entreaty of the
Calling Stone, and from this comes my belief that the Goblin tribes have gone
into hiding - because of knowledge - knowledge given to them by Loures, of the
events that will come to pass in Deoch 16, the year of Sgrios. Before this
disappearance, however, the Goblin society was stable, though neither growing
nor faltering. It appeared to have plateaued, just as the Grimlok they share
the caves with have. Whether they've disappeared for good, or will return,
only time can tell. At this point in time, the Goblins of Pravat are being
looked upon as nothing more than disappearing under suspicious circumstances.

The Wood Goblins, meanwhile, have a society that for some reason prospers,
despite constant battles with aislings. Perhaps they evolved to reproduce at a
rate that would ensure survival through the harshest conditions - which would
suggest a rising stage. Brightblade suggested a tribal society, but looked at
it as being extremely patriarchal. Which would make little sense, given the
role females must play to ensure a culture this embattled thrives. I think
Acinorev was closer to the truth when looking at the females gaining power
along with their mates - one thing not looked at is how power might be gained
by the number of sucessful births. It would perhaps, bear looking into, if one
wishes to conclude that their society is still growing.

This leaves the Goblins of Undine... This doesn't seem right, as though it
cannot be a proper society at all. No Goblins have ever learned the skills to
build ships - nor would they sail upon them naturally - which means they must
be working for a Mundane or Aisling. Nor does it make any sense for Goblins to
attempt to take a town. They've nothing to gain in doing so... At least,
nothing to gain naturally. Who can say what they might gain if they are indeed
working for some darker more sinister being? At this time, they seem content to
camp out in Astrid and the Fields of Undine, snatching children when given the
chance. Their presence so close to Undine is unsettling, and I fear it doesn't
bode well for the inhabitants of that little town. The "society" of these
goblins is one of creatures waiting for a battle. There is little evidence of
any kind of culture, being only warriors and providers are there. The absence
of any young is perhaps the most suspicious thing about their presence. As this
is apparently not a true culture, it has no stage to sit in.

## The Orcs

The Orcs are also split into two seperate cultures apparently - those of the
Kasmanium mines, and those of the Undine Fields.

The Orcs of the Kasmanium mines live relatively quiet lives, as most aislings
don't venture into the depths of their home \- out of fear, perhaps. Their
society is obviously in a plateau stage, as it hasn't changed in the least bit
over the deochs. They will defend their territory mercilessly against
intruders, yet seem content to share that same territory with the Draco's.
Perhaps they have some kind of agreement with each other that aislings know
nothing of - which suggest some intelligence on their part. For the most part,
theirs is a balanced culture, with both the males and females contributing
towards their lives, and the continuation of the species.

 The Orcs in the Fields of Undine, however, appear to be much like the Goblins
of the same place. Not a true culture - only warriors bent on the fulfillment
of their assigned task - whatever that may be. One could theorize about it for
some time, and never know whether you're right or wrong. At this time, they
wait. It stands to reason that we will eventually find out what their purpose
is, and perhaps even who they are working for. Rumours say Loures, whom is well
known to have somewhat shady dealing with many of the cultures of Temuair.

## The Dwarves

The Dwarven culture is nothing but the last fading echoes of a society that was
once great. To be sure, this is a culture that has fallen. Perhaps beyond even
the hope of redemption or new beginnings. Those dwarves that remain haunt the
Crypts of Abel, guarding whatever is hidden their fiercely. I'd suggest you
leave those dark and twisted creatures be, they're nothing of what dwarves once
were.

## The Mukul

The Mukul society is complex, and much like the Aisling society, in its own
way. The normal members of society are the Latika, all of whom have certain
titles and established roles - with the ability to gain others. Outcasts are
called Chandi, and are dangerous to all who come across them. The Latika Mukul
society is one in its rise, with astonishing cultural flourishes - this is the
only non-aisling society that has anything resembling priests, bards and
artisans, and historians. (Jivanta, Kerani, and Vibha, respectively.) I'd label
this culture as one either rising or plateauing. If you're ever in the swamps,
I suggest you collect some of the things the Latika are interested in and learn
a bit about their culture. If you see a Chandi, however, run the other way -
it's most likely looking to have your head as a trophy.

## The Dubhaimid

here are some who would argue whether the Dubhaimid are a society at all, as
all they seem to be interested in is killing and death - but then, there are
tales of the rare dubhmaid who have left that path to seek other things such
as love...

 The Dubmaid society is an odd one - they were created, intended, and indeed,
enjoy - killing things. They've killed mundanes, they've killed aislings,
they've razed every culture they've ever come across, all for the glory of
their lord Chadul. In Deoch 8, the year of Sgrios, the Dubhmaid entered the
towns and cities of Temuair, battling any who dared to set foot where they
were. Even the bright lights of Rucesion were no safeguard against them. With
Deoch 16, the year of Sgrios, approaching quickly, we are all preparing for a
scene like the one in Deoch 8... Death, destruction, pain, everywhere one
looks.. Armies of the dark and twisted Dubhmaid laughing cruelly as they kill
off whoever and whatever they come across. One would be hard pressed to say
what stage this culture is in. They hide from the light, deep within the Crypt
of Mileth, and the Castle of Dubhmaid, except for those rare occasions they
manage to escape whatever binds them there. If pressed, I'd say theirs is a
culture that has seen its peak - the Shadow Wars... Which would leave them in
the plateau stage.

## Aislings

The Aisling culture.. One could argue any point in this - there are seperate
examples of every stage enclosed theirein. One one hand, we have the rising
culture - the bards, lorekeepers, philosophers et al. Next, is the plateau
culture - the average aisling. And finally - the declining - the heretics and
"powerhunters" (a term, while not quite correct, used as the established norm
to denote an aisling that cares for nothing but being the most physically
powerful.)  

The general state of the aisling culture could be referenced by a single
ideal - the importance of number one, or the self. Generally speaking, a great
deal of aislings are self-centered and self-interested to the point that no one
else means anything to them, other than in passing. There are of course,
exceptions to this - but the brightest flames, sorrowfully, seem to burn out
the fastest.

_The greatest problem facing aislings on a whole is the breakdown of
communication._

At the top, a plan may be shaped to provide the greatest good for the greatest
number. But no plan conceived at one end of the spectrum can take into account
all of the individuals at the other end. It is simply not possible - there is
too much breakdown in communication along the way. Conversely, any system which
is modular enough to deal intimately with those at the bottom is too unwieldy
to be governed from the top.

Fortunately for those who govern - and unfortunately for those who don't - the
appearance of fair play is more easily obtained than the reality.

On a whole, the Aisling culture is one of constant flux - an example of chaos
in societal structures, one might say. Not being tribal, matriarchal,
patriarchal, or ruled by any other force, we focus on individuality, which
breaks down the idea of a state under the governable labels - those being rise,
plateau, and fall. From that, it might be said the Aisling society is so vastly
different from anything else that we may outlive all else. On the other hand -
the breakdown of communication may eventually destroy us.

Another condition that should be introduced - as I myself am an aisling, can I
judge our society and culture at all? I leave you your own interpretation on
that.
