# The Nature of the Dreamer

_A treatise on the aislings of Temuair, by Adamon_

You do not see it in the hands of Mundanes that toil mindlessly in Temuair.
Nay, the Spark does not dance unhindered in their eyes. Nor is it seen in the
unassuming minds of the peasantry of Mileth. But it exists - it is the
quintessence of the aisling - it is the dream.

We can catch a glimpse of it, a demure shimmering in the fathomless depths of a
lover's heart, or in the inquisitive grin of the irrepressable child. This
dream, it is the underlying quality which defines the anomaly of the aisling.
Without the spark, an aisling is little more than a mundane and like a mundane
has not the ability to fully embrace the Light.

In Temuair, we are the Tuatha de Danaan, the children of Danaan. As Danaan is
the Sun, and the genesis of all life, she is the Light - or at least, the
divine embodiment of the element of Light. After the War of Shadows, Deoch made
fruitful Danaan's labours and created the first aisling in the fall of that
same year. My postulate is incarnate therein: that the aisling, the dreamer is
the earthly embodiment of the Light, made possible by the Creative Spark.

The aisling has the innate potential for greatness inherent of the means of
their creation - Danaan's sacrifice and Deoch's fulfilment of Danaan's work.
The aisling is more than a knave or beggar wading through the sea of life
without purpose - they have the Spark in their eyes. The potential for
greatness is encapsulated in the dream, and made manifest in the realisation of
that dream. It is this transmutation from dream to reality that I deem the
Creative Spark. Hence, this can be extrapolated to imply that the aislings can
fully touch the core of the Light by means of the drawing inspiration from
their environs.

"The possibility is realised, the dream is brought into being,
And through the power of imagination is made real."

Temuairian politics, profiteering and senseless meandering are in fact mere
hinderances to a higher realisation of the potential of the aislings. The Spark
of Creation glimmers in the deep recesses of each aisling's spirit, at times
waxing, at times waning. It is when we are inspired that it shines it's
brightest, just as the Light will shine it's brightest - indeed, throughout
history, the most inspired of the aislings has been able to change the tide of
time and profoundly effect the psyche of Temuair. It is when we are inspired
that the dream is realised...

Some say that inspiration is an elaborate tappestry of lives, woven by the will
of the Gods. It is said that great poets do not write through their own will,
but that a divine hand guides their pen. Each artist of course has his/her
muse. And to each muse, a personal Mount Helicon - the zenith of inspiration.
The inspiration is personal, just as each flower-bud dreams in its slumber of
blossoming and each chrysalis dreams of emerging as a butterly, the dreams of
the aisling are innumerable and ever-varied. The ordinary is transmogrified
into the extroadinary, and via this metamorphosis, the aisling is able to tap
an even greater source of inspiration. The seemingly simple is for some a
virtual well of inspiration - their spark is strongest.

“_As a child, they could not keep me from wells
And old [ropes] with buckets and windlasses.
I loved the dark drop, the trapped sky, the smells
Of waterweed, fungus and dank moss._

_Others had echoes, gave back your own call
With a clean new music in it.
I rhyme...
To see myself, to set the darkness echoing._”

While the nature of the dreamings are infinite, within each aisling is the
fundemental essence of the Light. Path, creed, religion and politics are all
immaterial. In fashioning gems, the children of Fiosachd work to turn something
mundane into something of aesthetic potency. The Spark shines in the warrior
spirit of Ceannlaidir's vanguards. And while the warm embrace of Glioca and the
frigid grasp of Sgrios may seem to be conceptualised in two different worlds,
they are in actuality two sides of the same spectra - "the Creative Spark
interacts most explosively where the friction between death and love is
strongest, for Deoch turned from the hatred of death when touched by his love
for Danaan." However, lurking beneath the waves of human consciousness is the
potential for evil - to touch the Darkness. This realm is maddening, it is the
lifeless whisper of Chadul. On occassion, Sgrios' touch has wracked my body and
spirit, so I find this aspect of the aisling most distasteful; but I will say
this...While aislings are not innately evil, nor is tuathian magick, each
has the potential to work dark deeds and while this may be furthered by the
Creative Spark, it is not to further a spiritual oneness with the element of
Light and is hence not in accordance with Danaan's vision.

The Spark is never absent and never remains unrealised, only, not fully
realised. It cannot be known what the arcane will of the Gods was when Deoch
fulfilled Danaan's work, only the ramifications can be observed. Within each
aisling sleeps a dream, a dream that can be awakened and harnessed. The human
spirit is like a bellows, it can blow the Spark into a blaze, or it can snuff
out the kindled flame.

There is a myriad of possibilities.
